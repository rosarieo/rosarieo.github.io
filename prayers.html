<h2>Prayer for the Beatification of Venerable Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen</h2>
<p class="date">
Da per matrem me venire / Grant that I may come [to You] through the mother [Mary]
</p>
<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Heavenly Father, source of all good, all holiness, You reward those who love and serve You as faithful sons and daughters. If it pleases You, I ask you to glorify Archbishop Fulton John Sheen. He touched countless lives by his ministry of evangelization, especially through the media.</p>
<p>His clear and courageous teachings about Jesus Christ and the truths of the Catholic Church seemed to possess a special power of the Holy Spirit that strengthened the faithful and inspired many converts to embrace the faith.</p>
<p>He supported the needs of missionaries all over the world through his work in the National Office for the Propagation of the Faith.</p>
<p>He also labored zealously for the renewal of the priesthood by preaching retreats to his brother priests and by encouraging them with the good example of his daily Eucharistic holy hour.</p>
<p>His deep personal love for Our Lady moved many others to go to Jesus through His Mother.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, if it be according to Your divine will, I ask you to move Your Church to glorify your faithful servant, Archbishop Fulton John Sheen. I ask this prayer confidently in Jesus' Name.</p>
<p>Amen.<p>

<h3>Prayer To St Vincent de Paul I</h3>

  <p>Noble Saint Vincent de Paul, beloved servant of the poor, may we follow your example and do good works among those whom society has abandoned, enslaved, or forgotten.</p>
  <p>Inspire us to feed the hungry, to love a child, to provide comfort and medicine to the sick, to clothe those whose garments are threadbare, and to offer hope and our Lordâ€™s words to all who need respite.</p>
  <p>Pray for us to our beloved God to doing the same charitable acts that you did all your life, and intercede with him that we may have the favour of his guidance and strength and love upon this important and meaningful work. Amen.</p>
  <br>

<h3>Prayer To St Vincent de Paul II</h3>

  <p>St. Vincent, patron of all charitable associations and father of those who are in misery, come to our assistance.</p>
  <p>Obtain from Our Lord, help for the poor, relief for the infirm, consolation for the afflicted, protection for the abandoned, a spirit of generosity for the rich, grace of conversion for sinners, zeal for priests, peace for the Church, tranquillity and order for all nations, and salvation for them all.</p>
  <p>May we be united in the life to come, by your intercession, and experience joy, gladness, and everlasting happiness. Amen.</p>
  <br>

<h3>Words of Wisdom from St. Vincent de Paul</h3>
  <p>"No matter what others say or do, even if the wicked succeed, do not be troubled: commit everything to God and put your trust in him."</p>
  <p>"The most powerful weapon to conquer the devil is humility. For, as he does not know at all how to employ it, neither does he know how to defend himself from it."</p>
  <p>"But do you know what it is to labor in charity? It is to labor in God, for God is charity, and it is to labor for God purely and entirely; it is to do so in the grace of God."
