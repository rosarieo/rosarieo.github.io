<h3>APOSTLES' CREED</h3>
  <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;</p>
  <p>and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;</p>
  <p>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and buried.</p>
  <p>He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead;</p>
  <p>He ascended into Heaven, where he sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;</p>
  <p>from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.</p>
  <p>I believe in the Holy Ghost,</p>
  <p>the Holy Catholic Church,</p>
  <p>the Communion of Saints,</p>
  <p>the forgiveness of sins,</p>
  <p>the resurrection of the body,</p>
  <p>and life everlasting.</p>
