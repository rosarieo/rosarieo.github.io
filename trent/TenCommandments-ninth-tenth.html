<h3>THE NINTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS : &quot;<i>Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: neither shalt thou desire
his wife, nor his servant, nor his hand­maid, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor anything that is his</i>.&quot;</h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On These Two Commandments </h3>

<p>It is to be observed, in the first place, that these two
precepts, which were delivered last in order, furnish a general
principle for the observance of all the rest. What is commanded
in these two amounts to this, that if we wish to observe the
preceding precepts of the law, we must be particularly careful
not to covet. For he who does not covet, being content with what
he has, will not desire what belongs to others, but will rejoice
in their prosperity, will give glory to the immortal God, will
render Him boundless thanks, and will observe the Sabbath, that
is, will enjoy perpetual repose, and will respect his superiors.
In fine, he will injure no man in word or deed or otherwise; for
the root of all evil is concupiscence, which hurries its unhappy
victims into every species of crime and wickedness. Keeping these
considerations in mind, the pastor should be more diligent in
explaining this Commandment, and the faithful more ready to hear
(his instruction). </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why These Two Commandments Are Explained Here
Together</h3>

<p>We have united these two Commandments because, since their
subject­matter is similar, they may be treated together.
However, the pastor may explain them either together or
separately, according as he may deem it more effective for his
exhortations and admonitions. If, however, he has undertaken the
exposition of the Decalogue, he should point out in what these
two Commandments are dissimilar; how one covetousness differs
from another ­­ a difference noticed by St. Augustine, in his
book of Questions on Exodus. The one covetousness looks only to
utility and interest, the other to unlawful desire and criminal
pleasure. He, for instance, who covets a field or house, pursues
profit rather than pleasure, while he who covets another man's
wife yields to a desire of pleasure, not of profit.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of Promulgating These Two Commandments </h3>

<p>The promulgation of these two Commandments was necessary for
two reasons. The first is to explain the sixth and seventh
Commandments. Reason alone shows that to prohibit adultery is
also to prohibit the desire of another man's wife, because, were
the desire lawful, its indulgence must be so too; nevertheless,
many of the Jews, blinded by sin, could not be induced to believe
that such desires were prohibited by God. Nay, even after the Law
had been promulgated and become known, many who professed
themselves its interpreters, continued in the same error, as we
learn from these words of our Lord recorded in St. Matthew: You
have heard that it was said to them of old: &quot;Thou shalt not
commit adultery,&quot; but I say to you, etc.</p>

<p> The second reason (for the promulgation) of these two
Commandments is that they distinctly and in express terms
prohibit some things of which the sixth and seventh Commandments
do not contain an explicit prohibition. The seventh Commandment,
for instance, forbids an unjust desire or endeavour to take what
belongs to another; but this Commandment further prohibits even
to covet it in any way, even though it could be acquired justly
and lawfully, if we foresee that by such acquisition our
neighbour would suffer some loss.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>These Two Commandments Teach God's Love For Us And
Our Need Of Him</h3>

<p>But before we come to the exposition of the Commandments, the
faithful are first to be informed that by this law we are taught
not only to restrain our inordinate desires, but also to know the
boundless love of God towards us.</p>

<p> By the preceding Commandments God had, as it were, fenced us
round with safeguards, securing us and ours against injury of
every sort; but by the addition of these two Commandments, He
intended chiefly to provide against the injuries which we might
inflict on ourselves by the indulgence of inordinate desires, as
would easily happen were we at liberty to covet all things
indiscriminately. By this law then, which forbids to covet, God
has blunted in some degree the keenness of desire, which excites
to every kind of evil, so that by reason of His command these
desires are to some extent diminished, and we ourselves, freed
from the annoying importunity of the passions, are enabled to
devote more time to the performance of the numerous and important
duties of piety and religion which we owe to God.</p>

<p> Nor is this the only lesson of instruction which we derive
from these Commandments. They also teach us that the divine law
is to be observed not only by the external performance of duties,
but also by the internal concurrence of the heart. Between divine
and human laws, then, there is this difference, that human laws
are fulfilled by an external compliance alone, whereas the laws
of God, since He reads the heart, require purity of heart,
sincere and undefiled integrity of soul.</p>

<p> The law of God, therefore, is a sort of mirror, in which we
behold the corruption of our own nature; and hence these words of
the Apostle: I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not
say: &quot;Thou shalt not covet.&quot; ' Concupiscence, which is
the fuel of sin, and which originated in sin, is always inherent
in our fallen nature; from it we know that we are born in sin,
and, therefore, do we humbly fly for assistance to Him, who alone
can efface the stains of sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Two Parts Of These Commandments</h3>

<p>In common with the other Commandments, however, these two are
partly mandatory, partly prohibitory.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Negative Part</h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>&quot;Thou Shalt Not Covet&quot;</h3>

<p>With regard to the prohibitory part, the pastor should explain
what sort of concupiscence is prohibited by this law, lest some
may think that which is not sinful to be sinful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What Sort Of Concupiscence Is Not Forbidden</h3>

<p>Such is the concupiscence of the spirit against the flesh; Or
that which David so earnestly desired, namely, to long after the
justifications of God at all times.</p>

<p> Concupiscence, then, is a certain commotion and impulse of
the soul, urging men to the desire of pleasures, which they do
not actually enjoy. As the other propensities of the soul are not
always sinful, neither is the impulse of concupiscence always
vicious. It is not, for instance, sinful to desire food and
drink; when cold, to wish for warmth; when warm, to wish to
become cool. This lawful species of concupiscence was implanted
in us by the Author of nature; but in consequence of the sin of
our first parents it passed the limits prescribed by nature and
became so depraved that it frequently excites to the desire of
those things which conflict with the spirit and reason.</p>

<p> However, if well regulated, and kept within proper bounds, it
is often still the source of no slight advantage. In the first
place, it leads us to supplicate God continually, and humbly to
beg of Him those things which we most earnestly desire. Prayer is
the interpreter of our wishes; and if this lawful concupiscence
did not exist within us, prayer would be far less frequent in the
Church of God. It also makes us esteem the gifts of God more
highly; for the more eagerly we desire anything, the dearer and
more pleasing will be its possession to us. Finally, the
gratification which we receive from the acquisition of the
desired object increases the devotion of our gratitude to God.</p>

<p> If then it is sometimes lawful to covet, it must be conceded
that not every species of concupiscence is forbidden. St. Paul,
it is true, says that concupiscence is sin; but his words are to
be understood in the same sense as those of Moses, whom he cites,
as the Apostle himself declares when, in his Epistle to the
Galatians he calls it the concupiscence of the flesh for he says:
Walk in the ­spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the
flesh. </p>

<p> Hence that natural, well­regulated concupiscence which does
not go beyond its proper limits, is not prohibited; still less do
these Commandments forbid that spiritual desire of the virtuous
mind, which prompts us to long for those things that war against
the flesh, for the Sacred Scriptures themselves exhort us to such
a desire: Covet ye my words, Come over to me all ye that desire
me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What Sort Of Concupiscence Is Here Prohibited </h3>

<p>It is not, then, the mere power of desire, which can move
either to a good or a bad object that is prohibited by these
Commandments; it is the indulgence of evil desire, which is
called the concupiscence of the flesh, and the fuel of sin, and
which when accompanied by the consent of the will, is always
sinful. Therefore only that covetousness is forbidden which the
Apostle calls the concupiscence of the flesh, that is to say,
those motions of desire which are contrary to the dictates of
reason and outstep the limits prescribed by God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Two Kinds Of Sinful Concupiscence</h3>

<p>This kind of covetousness is condemned, either because it
desires what is evil, such as adultery, drunkenness, murder, and
such heinous crimes, of which the Apostle says: Let us not covet
evil things, as they also coveted; or because, although the
objects may not be bad in themselves, yet there is some other
reason which makes it wrong to desire them, as when, for
instance, God or His Church prohibit their possession; for it is
not permitted us to desire these things which it is altogether
unlawful to possess. Such were, in the Old Law, the gold and
silver from which idols were made, and which the Lord in
Deuteronomy forbade anyone to covet</p>

<p> Another reason why this sort of vicious desire is condemned
is that it has for its object that which belongs to another, such
as a house, maid­servant, field, wife, ox, ass and many other
things, all of which the law of God forbids us to covet, simply
because they belong to another. The desire of such things, when
consented to, is criminal, and is numbered among the most
grievous sins. For sin is committed the moment the soul, yielding
to the impulse of corrupt desires, is pleased with evil things,
and either consents to, or does not resist them, as St. James,
pointing out the beginning and progress of sin, teaches when he
says: Every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn
away and allured; then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it
bringeth forth sin; but sin, when it is completed, begetteth
death.</p>

<p> When, therefore, the Law says: Thou shalt not covet, it means
that we are not to desire those things which belong to others. A
thirst for what belongs to others is intense and insatiable; for
it is written: A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money;
and of such a one Isaias says: Woe to you that join house to
house, and lay field to field.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Various Objects We Are Forbidden To Covet </h3>

<p>But a distinct explanation of each of the words (in which this
Commandment is expressed) will make it easier to understand the
deformity and grievousness of this sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Thy Neighbour's House</h3>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should teach that by the word house is
to be understood not only the habitation in which we dwell, but
all our property, as we know from the usage and custom of the
sacred writers. Thus when it is said in Exodus that the Lord
built houses for the midwives, the meaning is that He improved
their condition and means.</p>

<p> From this interpretation, therefore, we perceive, that we are
forbidden to indulge an eager desire of riches, or to envy others
their wealth, or power, or rank; but, on the contrary, we are
directed to be content with our own condition, whether it be high
or low. Furthermore, it is forbidden to desire the glory of
others since glory also is comprised under the word house. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Nor His Ox, Nor His Ass'</h3>

<p>The words that follow, nor his ox, nor his ass, teach us that
not only is it unlawful to desire things of greater value, such
as a house, rank, glory, because they belong to others; but also
things of little value, whatever they may be, animate or
inanimate. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Nor His Servant</h3>

<p>The words, nor his servant, come next, and include captives as
well as other slaves whom it is no more lawful to covet than the
other property of our neighbour. With regard to the free who
serve voluntarily either for wages, or out of affection or
respect, it is unlawful, by words, or hopes, or promises, or
rewards to bribe or solicit them, under any pretext whatever, to
leave those to whose service they have freely engaged themselves;
nay more, if, before the period of their contract has expired,
they leave their employers, they are to be admonished, on the
authority of this Commandment, to return to them by all means. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Thy Neighbour's&quot;</h3>

<p>The word neighbour is mentioned in this Commandment to mark
the wickedness of those who habitually covet the lands, houses
and the like, which lie in their immediate vicinity; for
neighbourhood, which should make for friendship, is transformed
by covetousness from a source of love into a cause of hatred. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Goods For Sale Not Included Under This Prohibition </h3>

<p>But this Commandment is by no means transgressed by those who
desire to purchase or have actually purchased, at a fair price,
from a neighbour, the goods which he has for sale. Instead of
doing him an injury, they, on the contrary, very much assist
their neighbour, because to him the money will be much more
convenient and useful than the goods he sells.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;His Wife&quot;</h3>

<p>The Commandment which forbids us to covet the goods of our
neighbour, is followed by another, which forbids us to covet our
neighbour's wife ­­ a law that prohibits not only the
adulterer's criminal desire of his neighbour's wife, but even the
wish to marry her. For of old when a bill of divorce was
permitted, it might easily happen, that she who was put away by
one husband might be married to another. But the Lord forbade the
desire of another's wife lest husbands might be induced to
abandon their wives, or wives conduct themselves with such bad
temper towards their husbands as to make it necessary to send
them away.</p>

<p> But now this sin is more grievous because the wife, although
separated from her husband, cannot be taken in marriage by
another until the husband's death. He, therefore, who covets
another man's wife will easily fall from this into another
desire, for he will wish either the death of the husband or the
commission of adultery. </p>

<p> The same principle holds good with regard to women who have
been betrothed to another. To covet them is also unlawful; and
whoever strives to break their engagement violates one of the
most holy of promises.</p>

<p> And if to covet the wedded wife of another is entirely
unlawful, it is on no account right to desire in­ marriage the
virgin who is consecrated to religion and to the service of God.
But should anyone desire in marriage a married woman whom he
thinks to be single, and whom he would not wish to marry if he
knew she had a husband living, certainly he does not violate this
Commandment. Pharaoh and Abimelech, as the Scripture informs us,
were betrayed into this error; they wished to marry Sarah,
supposing her to be unmarried, and to be the sister, not the wife
of Abraham.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Positive Part</h3>

<h3>Detachment From Riches Enjoined</h3>

<p>In order to make known the remedies calculated to overcome the
vice of covetousness, the pastor should explain the positive part
of the Commandment, which consists in this, that if riches
abound, we set not our hearts upon them, that we be prepared to
sacrifice them for the sake of piety and religion, that we
contribute cheerfully towards the relief of the poor, and that,
if we ourselves are poor, we bear our poverty with patience and
joy. And, indeed, if we are generous with our own goods, we shall
extinguish (in our own hearts) the desire of what belongs to
another.</p>

<p> Concerning the praises of poverty and the contempt of riches,
the pastor will find little difficulty in collecting abundant
matter for the instruction of the faithful from the Sacred
Scriptures and the works of the Fathers.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Desire Of Heavenly And Spiritual Things Enjoined </h3>

<p>Likewise this Commandment requires us to desire, with all the
ardour and all the earnestness of our souls, the consummation,
not of our own wishes, but of the holy will of God, as it is
expressed in the Lord's Prayer. Now it is His will that we be
made eminent in holiness; that we preserve our souls pure and
undefiled; that we practice those duties of mind and spirit which
are opposed to sensuality; that we subdue our unruly appetites,
and enter, under the guidance of reason and of the spirit, upon a
virtuous course of life; and finally that we hold under restraint
those senses in particular which supply matter to the passions. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Thoughts which Help one to Keep these Commandments </h3>

<p>In order to extinguish the fire of passion, it will be found
most efficacious to place before our eyes the evil consequences
of its indulgence.</p>

<p> Among those evils the first is that by obedience to the
impulse of passion, sin gains uncontrolled sway over the soul;
hence the Apostle warns us: Let not sin, therefore, reign in your
mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof. Just as resistance
to the passions destroys the power of sin, so indulgence of the
passions expels God from His kingdom and introduces sin in His
place.</p>

<p> Again, concupiscence, as St. James teaches, is the source
from which flows very sin. Likewise St. John says: All that is in
the world is the concupiscence of the mesh, the concupiscence of
the eyes, and the pride of life.</p>

<p> A third evil of sensuality is that it darkens the
understanding. Blinded by passion man comes to regard whatever he
desires as lawful and even laudable.</p>

<p> Finally, concupiscence stifles the seed of the divine word,
sown in our souls by God, the great husband man. Some, it is
written in St. Mark, are sown among thorns; these are they who
hear the word, and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, and the lust after other things, entering in, choke
the word, and it is made fruitless.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Chief Ways in which These two Commandments are
Violated</h3>

<p>They who, more than others, are the slaves of concupiscence,
the pastor should exhort with greater earnestness to observe this
Commandment. Such are the following: those who are addicted to
improper amusements, or who are immoderately given to recreation;
merchants, who wish for scarcity, and who cannot bear that other
buyers or sellers hinder them from selling at a higher or buying
at a lower rate; those who wish to see their neighbour reduced to
want in order that they themselves may profit in buying or
selling; soldiers who thirst for war, in order to enrich
themselves with plunder; physicians, who wish for the spread of
disease; lawyers, who are anxious for a great number of­cases
and litigations; and artisans who, through greed for gain, wish
for a scarcity of the necessaries of life in order that they may
increase their profits.</p>

<p> They too, sin gravely against this Commandment, who, because
they are envious of the praise and glory won by others, strive to
tarnish in some degree their fame, particularly if they
themselves are idle and worthless characters; for fame and glory
are the reward of virtue and industry, not of indolence and
laziness. </p>
