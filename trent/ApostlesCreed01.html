<h3><center>ARTICLE I : &quot;I BELIEVE IN GOD, THE
FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Meaning Of This Article</h3>

<p>The meaning of the above words is this: I believe with
certainty, and without a shadow of doubt profess my belief in God
the Father, the First Person of the Trinity, who by His
omnipotence created from nothing and preserves and governs the
heavens and the earth and all things which they contain; and not
only do I believe in Him from my heart and profess this belief
with my lips, but with the greatest ardour and piety I tend
towards Him, as the supreme and most perfect good.</p>

<p> Let this serve as a brief summary of this first Article. But
since great mysteries lie concealed under almost every word, the
pastor must now give them a more careful consideration, in order
that, as far as God has permitted, the faithful may approach,
with fear and trembling, to contemplate the glory of His majesty.
</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;I Believe&quot;</h3>

<p>The word believe does not here mean to think, to suppose, lo
be of opinion; but, as the Sacred Scriptures teach, it expresses
the deepest conviction, by which the mind gives a firm and
unhesitating assent to God revealing His mysterious truths. As
far, therefore, as regards use of the word here, he who firmly
and without hesitation is convinced of anything is said to
believe. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Faith Excludes Doubt</h3>

<p>The knowledge derived through faith must not be considered
less certain because its objects are not seen; for the divine
light by which we know them, although it does not render them
evident, yet suffers us not to doubt them. For God, who commanded
the light to shine out of darkness, hath himself shone in our
hearts, that the gospel be not hidden to us, as to those that
perish.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Faith Excludes Curiosity</h3>

<p>From what has been said it follows that he who is gifted with
this heavenly knowledge of faith is free from an inquisitive
curiosity. For when God commands us to believe He does not
propose to us to search into His divine judgments, or inquire
into their reason and cause, but demands an unchangeable faith,
by which the mind rests content in the knowledge of eternal
truth. And indeed, since we have the testimony of the Apostle
that God is true; and every man a liar, and since it would argue
arrogance and presumption to disbelieve the word of a grave and
sensible man affirming anything as true, and to demand that he
prove his statements by arguments or witnesses, how rash and
foolish are those, who, hearing the words of God Himself, demand
reasons for His heavenly and saving doctrines? Faith, therefore,
must exclude not only all doubt, but all desire for
demonstration.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Faith Requires Open Profession</h3>

<p>The pastor should also teach that he who says, I believe,
besides declaring the inward assent of the mind, which is an
internal act of faith, should also openly profess and with
alacrity acknowledge and proclaim what he inwardly and in his
heart believes. For the faithful should be animated by the same
spirit that spoke by the lips of the Prophet when he said: I
believe; and therefore did I speak, and should follow the example
of the Apostles who replied to the princes of the people: We
cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. They
should be encouraged by these noble words of St. Paul: I am not
ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation
to every one that believeth; and likewise by those other words;
in which the truth of this doctrine is expressly confirmed: With
the heart we believe unto justice; but with the mouth confession
is made unto salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;In God&quot;</h3>

<p>From these words we may learn how exalted are the dignity and
excellence of Christian wisdom, and what a debt of gratitude we
owe to the divine goodness. For to us it is given at once to
mount as by the steps of faith to the knowledge of what is most
sublime and desirable.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Knowledge Of God More Easily Obtained Through Faith
Than Through Reason</h3>

<p>There is a great difference between Christian philosophy and
human wisdom. The latter, guided solely by the light of nature,
advances slowly by reasoning on sensible objects and effects, and
only after long and laborious investigation is it able at length
to contemplate with difficulty the invisible things of God, to
discover and understand a First Cause and Author of all things.
Christian philosophy, on the contrary, so quickens the human mind
that without difficulty it pierces the heavens, and, illumined
with divine light, contemplates first, the eternal source of
light, and in its radiance all created things: so that we
experience with the utmost pleasure of mind that we have been
called, as the Prince of the Apostles says, out of darkness into
his admirable light, and believing we rejoice with joy
unspeakable.</p>

<p> Justly, therefore, do the faithful profess first to believe
in God, whose majesty, with the Prophet Jeremias, we declare
incomprehensible. For, as the Apostle says, He dwells in light
inaccessible, which no man hath seen, nor can see; as God
Himself, speaking to Moses, said: No man shall see my face and
live. The mind cannot rise to the contemplation of the Deity,
whom nothing approaches in sublimity, unless it be entirely
disengaged from the senses, and of this in the present life we
art naturally incapable.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is Clearer </h3>

<p>But while this is so, yet God, as the Apostle says, left not
himself without testimony, doing good from heaven, giving rains
and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
Hence it is that the philosophers conceived no mean idea of the
Divinity, ascribed to Him nothing corporeal, gross or composite.
They considered Him the perfection and fullness of all good, from
whom, as from an eternal, inexhaustible fountain of goodness and
benignity, flows every perfect gift to all creatures. They called
Him the wise, the author and lover of truth, the just, the most
beneficent, and gave Him also many other appellations expressive
of supreme and absolute perfection. They recognised that His
immense and infinite power fills every place and extends to all
things </p>

<p> These truths the Sacred Scriptures express far better and
much more clearly, as in the following passages: God is a spirit;
Be ye perfect, even as also your heavenly Father is perfect; All
things are naked and open to his eyes; O the depth of the riches
of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! God is true; I am the
way, the truth, and the life; Thy right hand is full of justice;
Thou openest thy hand, and fillest with blessing every living
creature; and finally: Whither shall go from thy spirit? or
whither shall I flee from thy face? If I ascend into heaven, thou
art there; if I descend into hell, thou art there. If I take my
wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of
the sea, etc., and Do I not fill heaven and earth, saith the
Lord? </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is More
Certain</h3>

<p>These great and sublime truths regarding the nature of God,
which are in full accord with Scripture, the philosophers were
able to learn from an investigation of God's works. But even here
we see the necessity of divine revelation if we reflect that not
only does faith, as we have already observed, make known clearly
and at once to the rude and unlettered, those truths which only
the learned could discover, and that by long study; but also that
the knowledge obtained through faith is much more certain and
more secure against error than if it were the result of
philosophical inquiry.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is More Ample
And Exalted</h3>

<p>But how much more exalted must not that knowledge of the Deity
be considered, which cannot be acquired in common by all from the
contemplation of nature, but is peculiar to those who are
illumined by the light of faith ?</p>

<p> This knowledge is contained in the Articles of the Creed,
which disclose to us the unity of the Divine Essence and the
distinction of Three Persons, and show also that God Himself is
the ultimate end of our being, from whom we are to expect the
enjoyment of the eternal happiness of heaven, according to the
words of St. Paul: God is a rewarder of them that seek Him. How
great are these rewards, and whether they are such that human
knowledge could aspire to their attainment, we learn from these
words of Isaias uttered long before those of the Apostle: From
the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived
with the ears: the eye hath not seen besides thee, O God, what
things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Unity Of Nature In God</h3>

<p>From what is said it must also be confessed that there is but
one God, not many gods. For we attribute to God supreme goodness
and infinite perfection, and it is impossible that what? is
supreme and most perfect could be common to many. If a being lack
anything that constitutes supreme perfection, it is therefore
imperfect and cannot have the nature of God.</p>

<p> The unity of God is also proved from many passages of Sacred
Scripture. It is written: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one
Lord; again the Lord commands: Thou shalt not have strange gods
before me; and further He often admonishes us by the Prophet: I
am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.
The Apostle also openly declares: One Lord, one faith, one
baptism.</p>

<p> It should not, however, excite our surprise if the Sacred
Scriptures sometimes give the name of God to creatures. For when
they call the Prophets and judges gods, they do not speak
according to the manner of the Gentiles, who, in their folly and
impiety, formed to themselves many gods; but express, by a manner
of speaking then in use, some eminent quality or function
conferred on such persons by the gift of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Trinity Of Persons In God</h3>

<p>The Christian faith, therefore, believes and professes, as is
declared in the Nicene Creed in confirmation of this truth, that
God in His Nature, Substance and Essence is one.­ But soaring
still higher, it so understands Him to be one that it adores
unity in trinity and trinity in unity. Of this mystery we now
proceed to speak, as it comes next in order in the Creed. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;The Father&quot;</h3>

<p>As God is called Father for more reasons than one, we must
first determine the more appropriate sense in which the word is
used in the present instance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God Is Called Father Because He Is Creator And Ruler</h3>

<p>Even some on whose darkness the light of faith never shone
conceived God to be an eternal substance from whom all things
have their beginning, and by whose Providence they are governed
and preserved in their order and state of existence. Since,
therefore, he to whom a family owes its origin and by whose
wisdom</p>

<p> derived from human things these persons gave the name Father
to God, whom they acknowledge to be the Creator and Governor of
the universe. The Sacred Scriptures also, when they wish to show
that to God must be ascribed the creation of all things, supreme
power and admirable Providence, make use of the same name. Thus
we read: Is not he thy Father, that hath possessed thee, and made
thee and created thee? And: Have we not all one Father? hath not
one God created us?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God Is Called Father Because He Adopts Christians
Through Grace</h3>

<p>But God, particularly in the New Testament, is much more
frequently, and in some sense peculiarly, called the Father of
Christians, who have not received the spirit of bondage again in
fear; but have received the spirit of adoption of sons (of God),
whereby they cry: Abba (Father). For the Father hath bestowed
upon us that manner of charity that we should be called, and be
the sons of God, and if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God,
and joint­heirs with Christ, who is the first­born amongst many
brethren, and is not ashamed to call us brethren. Whether,
therefore, we look to the common title of creation and
Providence, or to the special one of spiritual adoption, rightly
do the faithful profess their belief that God is their Father.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Name Father Also Discloses The Plurality Of
Persons In God</h3>

<p>But the pastor should teach that on hearing the word Father,
besides the ideas already unfolded, the mind should rise to more
exalted mysteries. Under the name Father, the divine oracles
begin to unveil to us a mysterious truth which is more abstruse
and more deeply hidden in that inaccessible light in which God
dwells, and which human reason and understanding could not attain
to, nor even conjecture to exist.</p>

<p> This name implies that in the one Essence of the Godhead is
proposed to our belief, not only one Person, but a distinction of
persons; for in one Divine Nature there are Three Persons­the
Father, begotten of none; the Son, begotten of the Father before
all ages; the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the
likewise, from all eternity</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Doctrine Of The Trinity</h3>

<p>In the one Substance of the Divinity the Father is the First
Person, who with His Only­begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost, is
one God and one Lord, not in the singularity of one Person, but
in the trinity of one Substance. These Three Persons, since it
would be impiety to assert that they are unlike or unequal in any
thing, are understood to be distinct only in their respective
properties. For the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten of the
Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from both. Thus we
acknowledge the Essence and the Substance of the Three Persons to
be the same in such wise that we believe that in confessing the
true and eternal God we are piously and religiously to adore
distinction in the Persons, unity in the Essence, and equality in
the Trinity.</p>

<p> Hence, when we say that the Father is the First Person, we
are not to be understood to mean that in the Trinity there is
anything first or last, greater or less. Let none of the faithful
be guilty of such impiety, for the Christian religion proclaims
the same eternity, the same majesty of glory in the Three
Persons. But since the Father is the Beginning without a
beginning, we truly and unhesitatingly affirm that He is the
First Person, and as He is distinct from the Others by His
peculiar relation of paternity, so of Him alone is it true that
He begot the Son from eternity. For when in the Creed we
pronounce together the words God and Father, it means that He was
always both God and Father. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Practical Admonitions Concerning The Mystery Of The
Trinity </h3>

<p>Since nowhere is a too curious inquiry more dangerous, or
error more fatal, than in the knowledge and exposition of this,
the most profound and difficult of mysteries, let the pastor
teach that the terms nature and person used to express this
mystery should be most scrupulously retained; and let the
faithful know that unity belongs to essence, and distinction to
persons.</p>

<p> But these are truths which should not be made the subject of
too subtle investigation, when we recollect that he who is a
searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory. We should be
satisfied with the assurance and certitude which faith gives us
that we have been taught these truths by God Himself, to doubt
whose word is the extreme of folly and misery. He has said: Teach
ye all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and again, there are three who
give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Ghost; and these three are one.</p>

<p> Let him, however, who by the divine bounty believes these
truths, constantly beseech and implore God and the Father, who
made all things out of nothing, and ordereth an things sweetly,
who gave us power to become the sons of God, and who made known
to the human mind the mystery of the Trinity ­­ let him, I say,
pray unceasingly that, admitted one day into the eternal
tabernacles, he may be worthy to see how great is the fecundity
of the Father, who contemplating and understanding Himself, begot
the Son like and equal to Himself, how a love of charity in both,
entirely the same and equal, which is the Holy Ghost, proceeding
from the Father and the Son, connects the begetter and the
begotten by an eternal and indissoluble bond; and that thus the
Essence of the Trinity is one and the distinction of the Three
Persons perfect.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Almighty&quot;</h3>

<p>The Sacred Scriptures, in order to mark the piety and devotion
with which the most holy name of God is to be adored, usually
express His supreme power and infinite majesty in a variety of
ways; but the pastor should, first of all, teach that almighty
power is most frequently attributed to Him. Thus He says of
Himself: I am the almighty Lord and again, Jacob when sending his
sons to Joseph thus prayed for them: May my almighty God make him
favourable to you. In the Apocalypse also it is written: The Lord
God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty; and
in another place the last day is called the great day of the
almighty God. Sometimes the same attribute is expressed in many
words; thus: No word shall be impossible with God; Is the hand of
the Lord unable? Thy power is at hand when thou wiIt, and so on.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning Of The Term &quot;Almighty&quot;</h3>

<p>From these various modes of expression it is clearly perceived
what is comprehended under this single word almighty. By it we
understand that there neither exists nor can be conceived in
thought or imagination anything which God cannot do. For not only
can He annihilate all created things, and in a moment summon from
nothing into existence many other worlds, an exercise of power
which, however great, comes in some degree within our
comprehension; but He can do many things still greater, of which
the human mind can form no conception.</p>

<p> But though God can do all things, yet He cannot lie, or
deceive, or be deceived; He cannot sin, or cease to exist, or be
ignorant of anything. These defects are compatible with those
beings only whose actions are imperfect; but God, whose acts are
always most perfect, is said to be incapable of such things,
simply because the capability of doing them implies weakness, not
the supreme and infinite power over all things which God
possesses. Thus we so believe God to be omnipotent that we
exclude from Him entirely all that is not intimately connected
and consistent with the perfection of His nature.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why Omnipotence Alone Is Mentioned In The: Creed </h3>

<p>The pastor should point out the propriety and wisdom of having
omitted all other names of God in the Creed, and of having
proposed to us only that of almighty as the object of our belief.
For by acknowledging God to be omnipotent, we also of necessity
acknowledge Him to be omniscient, and to hold all things in
subjection to His supreme authority and dominion. When we do not
doubt that He is omnipotent, we must be also convinced of
everything else regarding Him, the absence of which would render
His omnipotence altogether unintelligible.</p>

<p> Besides, nothing tends more to confirm our faith and animate
our hope than a deep conviction that all things are possible to
God; for whatever may be afterwards proposed as an object of
faith, however great, however wonderful, however raised above the
natural order, is easily and without hesitation believed, once
the mind has grasped the knowledge of the omnipotence of God. Nay
more, the greater the truths which the divine oracles announce,
the more willingly does the mind deem them worthy of belief. And
should we expect any favour from heaven, we are not discouraged
by the greatness of the desired benefit, but are cheered and
confirmed by frequently considering that there is nothing which
an omnipotent God cannot effect.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Advantages Of Faith In God's Omnipotence</h3>

<p>With this faith, then, we should be specially fortified
whenever we are required to render any extraordinary service to
our neighbour or seek to obtain by prayer any favour from God.
Its necessity in the one case we learn from the Lord Himself,
who, when rebuking the incredulity of the Apostles, said: If you
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this
mountain: Remove from hence thither, and it shall remove; and
nothing shall be impossible to you; and in the other case, from
these words of St. James: Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved
and carried about by the wind. Therefore let not that man think
that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>

<p> This faith brings with it also many advantages and helps. It
forms us, in the first place, to all humility and lowliness of
mind, according to these words of the Prince of the Apostles: Be
you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God. It also
teaches us not to fear where there is no cause of fear, but to
fear God alone, in whose power we ourselves and all that we have
are placed; for our Saviour says: I will shew you whom you shall
fear; fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast
into hell. This faith is also useful to enable us to know and
exalt the infinite mercies of God towards us. For he who reflects
on the omnipotence of God, cannot be so ungrateful as not
frequently to exclaim: He that is mighty, hath done great things
to me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Not Three Almighties But One Almighty</h3>

<p>When, however, in this Article we call the Father almighty,
let no one be led into the error of thinking that this attribute
is so ascribed to Him as not to belong also to the Son and the
Holy Ghost. As we say the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy
Ghost is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God; so in
like manner we confess that the Father is almighty, the Son
almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty, and yet there are not
three almighties but one almighty.</p>

<p> The Father, in particular, we call almighty, because He is
the Source of all being; as we also attribute wisdom to the Son,
because He is the eternal Word of the Father; and goodness to the
Holy Ghost, because He is the love of both. These, however, and
similar appellations, may be given indiscriminately to the Three
Persons, according to the teaching of Catholic faith.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Creator&quot;</h3>

<p>The necessity of having previously imparted to the faithful a
knowledge of the omnipotence of God will appear from what we are
now about to explain with regard to the creation of the world.
The wondrous production of so stupendous a work is more easily
believed when all doubt concerning the immense power of the
Creator has been removed.</p>

<p> For God formed the world not from materials of any sort, but
created it from nothing, and that not by constraint or necessity,
but spontaneously, and of His own free will. Nor was He impelled
to create by any other cause than a desire to communicate His
goodness to creatures. Being essentially happy in Himself He
stands not in need of anything, as David expresses it: I have
said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my
goods.</p>

<p> As it was His own goodness that influenced Him when He did
all things whatsoever He would, so in the work of creation He
followed no external form or model; but contemplating, and as it
were imitating, the universal model contained in the divine
intelligence, the supreme Architect, with infinite wisdom and
power­attributes peculiar to the Divinity ­­ created all
things in the be ginning. He spoke and they were made: he
commanded and they were created.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Of Heaven and Earth&quot;</h3>

<p>The words heaven and earth include all things which the
heaven's and the earth contain; for besides the heavens, which
the Prophet has called the works of his fingers, He also gave to
the sun its brilliancy, and to the moon and stars their beauty;
and that they might be for signs, and for seasons, and for days
and years. He so ordered the celestial bodies in a certain and
uniform course, that nothing varies more than their continual
revolution, while nothing is more fixed than their variety.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Creation Of The World Of Spirits</h3>

<p>Moreover, He created out of nothing the spiritual world and
Angels innumerable to serve and minister to Him; and these He
enriched and adorned with the admirable gifts of His grace and
power.</p>

<p> That the devil and the other rebel angels were gifted from
the beginning of their creation with grace, clearly follows from
these words of the Sacred Scriptures: He (the devil) stood not in
the truth. On this subject St. Augustine says: In creating the
Angels He endowed them with good will, that is, with pure love
that they might adhere to Him, giving them existence and adorning
them with grace at one and the same time. Hence we are to believe
that the holy Angels were never without good will, that is, the
love of God.</p>

<p> As to their knowledge we have this testimony of Holy
Scripture: Thou, my Lord, O king, art wise, according to the
wisdom of an angel of God, to understand all things upon earth.'
Finally, the inspired David ascribes power to them, saying that
they are mighty in strength, and execute his word; and on this
account they are often called in Scripture the powers and the
armies of the Lord. </p>

<p> But although they were all endowed with celestial gifts, very
many, having rebelled against God, their Father and Creator, were
hurled from those high mansions of bliss, and shut up in the
darkest dungeon of earth, there to suffer for eternity the
punishment of their pride. Speaking of them the Prince of the
Apostles says: God spared not the angels that sinned, but
delivered them, drawn by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto
torments, to be reserved unto judgment.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Formation Of The Universe</h3>

<p>The earth also God commanded to stand in the midst of the
world, rooted in its own foundation, and made the mountains
ascend, and the plains descend into the place which he had
founded for them. That the waters should not inundate the earth,
He set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they
return to cover the earth. He next not only clothed and adorned
it with trees and every variety of plant and flower, but filled
it, as He had already filled the air and water, with innumerable
kinds of living creatures.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Production Of Man</h3>

<p>Lastly, He formed man from the slime of the earth, so created
and constituted in body as to be immortal and impassible, not,
however, by the strength of nature, but by the bounty of God.
Man's soul He created to His own image and likeness; gifted him
with free will, and tempered all his motions and appetites so as
to subject them, at all times, to the dictates of reason. He then
added the admirable gift of original righteousness, and next gave
him dominion over all other animals. By referring to the sacred
history of Genesis the pastor will easily make himself familiar
with these things for the instruction of the faithful. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Of all Things Visible and Invisible&quot; </h3>

<p>What we have said, then, of the creation of the universe is to
be understood as conveyed by the words heaven and earth, and is
thus briefly set forth by the Prophet: Thine are the heavens, and
thine is the earth: the world and the fullness thereof thou hast
founded. Still more briefly the Fathers of the Council of Nice
expressed this truth by adding in their Creed these words: of all
things visible and invisible. Whatever exists in the universe,
whatever we confess to have been created by God, either falls
under the senses and is included in the word visible, or is an
object of mental perception and intelligence and is expressed by
the word invisible.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God Preserves, Rules And Moves All Created Things </h3>

<p>We are not, however, to understand that God is in such wise
the Creator and Maker of all things that His works, when once
created and finished, could thereafter continue to exist
unsupported by His omnipotence. For as all things derive
existence from the Creator's supreme power, wisdom, and goodness,
so unless preserved continually by His Providence, and by the
same power which produced them, they would instantly return into
their nothingness. This the Scriptures declare when they say: How
could anything endure if thou wouldst not? or be preserved, if
not called by thee?</p>

<p> Not only does God protect and govern all things by His
Providence, but He also by an internal power impels to motion and
action whatever moves and acts, and this in such a manner that,
although He excludes not, He yet precedes the agency of secondary
causes. For His invisible influence extends to all things, and,
as the Wise Man says, reaches from end to end mightily, and
ordereth all things sweetly. This is the reason why the Apostle,
announcing to the Athenians the God whom, not knowing, they
adored, said: He is not far from every one of us: for in him we
live, and move, and are.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Creation Is The Work Of The Three Persons</h3>

<p>Let so much suffice for the explanation of the first Article
of the Creed. It may not be superfluous, however, to add that
creation is the common work of the Three Persons of the Holy and
undivided Trinity, ­­ of the Father, whom according to the
doctrine of the Apostles we here declare to be Creator of heaven
and earth; of the Son, of whom the Scripture says, all things
were made by him; and of the Holy Ghost, of whom it is written:
The spirit of God moved over the waters, and again, By the word
of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of
them by the spirit of his mouth.</p>
