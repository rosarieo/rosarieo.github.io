<h3>THE SECOND COMMANDMENT: &quot;<i>Thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain</i>&quot;</h3>

<h3>Why This Commandment Is Distinct From The First </h3>

<p>The second Commandment of the divine law is necessarily
comprised in the first, which commands us to worship God in piety
and holiness For he who requires that honour be paid him, also
requires that he be spoken of with reverence, and must forbid the
contrary, as is clearly shown by these words of the Lord in
Malachy: The son honoureth the father and the servant his master
if then I be a father, where is my honour?</p>

<p> However, on account of the importance of the obligation, God
wished to make the law, which commands His own divine and most
holy name to be honoured, a distinct Commandment, expressed in
the clearest and simplest terms.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment </h3>

<p>The above observation should strongly convince the pastor that
on this point it is not enough to speak in general terms; that
the importance of the subject is such as to require it to be
dwelt upon at considerable length, and to be explained to the
faithful in all its bearings with distinctness, clearness and
accuracy. </p>

<p> This diligence cannot be deemed superfluous, since there are
not wanting those who are so blinded by the darkness of error as
not to dread to blaspheme His name, whom the Angels glorify Men
are not deterred by the Commandment laid down from shamelessly
and daringly outraging Him divine Majesty every day, or rather
every hour and moment of the day Who is ignorant that every
assertion is accompanied with an oath and teems with curses and
imprecations? To such lengths has this impiety been carried, that
there is scarcely anyone who buys, or sells, or transacts
business of any sort, without having recourse to swearing, and
who, even in matters the most unimportant and trivial, does not
profane the most holy name of God thousands of times.</p>

<p> It therefore becomes more imperative on the pastor not to
neglect, carefully and frequently, to admonish the faithful how
grievous and detestable is this crime.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Positive Part of this Commandment</h3>

<p>But in the exposition of this Commandment it should first be
shown that besides a negative, it also contains a positive
precept, commanding the performance of a duty To each of these a
separate explanation should be given; and for the sake of easier
exposition what the Commandment requires should be first set
forth, and then what it forbids It commands us to honour the name
of God, and to swear by it with reverence It prohibits us to
contemn the divine name, to take it in vain, or swear by it
falsely, unnecessarily or rashly.</p>

<p> In the part which commands us to honour the name of God, the
command, as the pastor should show the faithful, is not directed
to the letters or syllables of which that name is composed, or in
any respect to the mere name; but to the meaning of a word used
to express the Omnipotent and Eternal Majesty of the Godhead,
Trinity in Unity Hence we easily infer the superstition of those
among the Jews who, while they hesitated not to write, dared not
to pronounce the name of God, as if the divine power consisted in
the four letters, and not in the signification.</p>

<p> Although this Commandment uses the singular number, Thou
shalt not take the name of God, this is not to be understood to
refer to any one name, but to every name by which God is
generally designated For He is called by many names, such as the
Lord, the Almighty, the Lord of hosts, the King of kings, the
Strong, and by others of similar nature, which we meet in
Scripture and which are all entitled to the same and equal
veneration</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Various Ways Of Honouring God's Name</h3>

<p>It should next be taught how due honour is to be given to the
name of God Christians, whose tongues should constantly celebrate
the divine praises, are not to be ignorant of a matter so
important, indeed, most necessary to salvation The name of God
may be honoured in a variety of ways; but all may be reduced to
those that follow. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Profession Of Faith</h3>

<p>In the first place, God's name is honoured when we publicly
and confidently confess Him to be our Lord and our God; and when
we acknowledge and also proclaim Christ to be the author of our
salvation. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Respect For The Word Of God</h3>

<p>(It is also honoured) when we pay a religious attention to the
word of God, which announces to us His will; make it the subject
of our constant meditation; and strive by reading or hearing it,
according to our respective capacities and conditions of life, to
become acquainted with it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Praise And Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Again, we honour and venerate the name of God, when, from a
sense of religious duty, we celebrate His praises, and under all
circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, return Him
unbounded thanks Thus spoke the Prophet Bless the Lord, O my
soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee. Among the
Psalms of David there are many, in which, animated with singular
piety towards God, he chants in sweetest strains the divine
praises There is also the example of the admirable patience of
Job, who, when visited with the heaviest and most appalling
calamities, never ceased, with lofty and unconquered soul, to
give praise to God When, therefore, we labour under affliction of
mind or body, when oppressed by misery and misfortune, let us
instantly direct all our thoughts, and all the powers of our
souls, to the praises of God, saying with Job Blessed be the name
of the Lord. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer</h3>

<p>The name of God is not less honoured when we confidently
invoke His assistance, either to relieve us from our afflictions,
or to give us constancy and strength to endure them with
fortitude This is in accordance with the Lord's own wishes Call
upon me, He says, in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me. We have illustrious examples of such
supplications in many passages of Scripture, and especially in
the sixteenth, forty­third, and one hundred and eighteenth
Psalms.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Oaths</h3>

<p>Finally, we honour the name of God when we solemnly call upon
Him to witness the truth of what we assert This mode of honouring
God's name differs much from those already­ enumerated Those
means are in their own nature so good, so desirable, that our
days and nights could not be more happily or more holily spent
than in such practices of piety I will bless the Lord at all
times, says David, his praise shall be always in my mouth. On the
other hand, although oaths are in themselves good, their frequent
use is by no means praiseworthy.</p>

<p> The reason of this difference is that oaths have been
instituted only as remedies to human frailty, and a necessary
means of establishing the truth of what we assert As it is
inexpedient to have recourse to medicine unless, when it becomes
necessary, and as its frequent use is harmful; so with regard to
oaths, it is not profitable to have recourse to them, unless
there is a weighty and just cause; and frequent recurrence to
them, far from being advantageous, is on the contrary highly
prejudicial Hence the excellent observation of St Chrysostom
Oaths were introduced among men, not at the beginning of the
world, but long after; when vice had spread far and wide over the
earth; when all things were disturbed and universal confusion
reigned out; when, to complete human depravity, almost all
mankind debased the dignity of their nature by the degrading
service of idols. Then at length it was that the custom of oaths
was introduced. For the perfidy and wickedness of men was so
great that it was with difficulty that anyone could be induced to
credit the assertion of another, and they began to call on God as
a witness.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning Of An Oath</h3>

<p>Since in explaining this part of the Commandment the chief
object is to teach the faithful how to render an oath reverential
and holy, it is first to be observed, that to swear, whatever the
form of words may be, is nothing else than to call God to
witness; thus to say, God is witness, and By God, mean one and
the same thing.</p>

<p> To swear by creatures, such as the holy Gospels, the cross,
the names or relics of the Saints, and so on, in order to prove
our statements, is also to take an oath Of themselves, it is
true, such objects give no weight or authority to an oath; it is
God Himself who does this, whose divine majesty shines forth in
them Hence to swear by the Gospel is to swear by God Himself,
whose truth is contained and revealed in the Gospel (This holds
equally true with regard to those who swear) by the Saints, who
are the temples of God, who believed the truth of His Gospel,
were faithful in its observance, and spread it far and wide among
the nations and peoples.</p>

<p> This is also true of oaths uttered by way of execration, such
as that of St Paul I call God to witness upon my soul. By this
form of oath one submits himself to God's judgment, who is the
avenger of falsehood We do not, however, deny that some of these
forms may be used without constituting an oath; but even in such
cases it will be found useful to observe what has been said with
regard to an oath, and to conform exactly to the same rule and
standard.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Oaths Are Affirmatory And Promissory</h3>

<p>Oaths are of two kinds The first is an affirmatory oath, and
is taken when we religiously affirm anything, past or present.
Such was the affirmation of the Apostle in his Epistle to the
Galatians: Behold, before God, I lie not. The second kind, to
which comminations may be reduced, is called promissory It looks
to the future, and is taken when we promise and affirm for
certain that such or such a thing will be done Such was the oath
of David, who, swearing by the Lord his God, promised to
Bethsabee his wife that her son Solomon should be heir to his
kingdom and successor to his throne. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conditions Of A Lawful Oath</h3>

<p>Although to constitute an oath it is sufficient to call God to
witness, yet to constitute a holy and just oath many other
conditions are required, which should be carefully explained
These, as St Jerome observes, are briefly enumerated in the words
of Jeremias Thou shalt swear: as the Lord liveth, in truth and in
judgment and in justice, words which briefly sum up all the
conditions that constitute the perfection of an oath, namely,
truth, judgment, justice.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Condition: Truth</h3>

<p>Truth, then, holds the first place in an oath What is asserted
must be true and he who swears must believe what he swears to be
true, being influenced not by rash judgment or mere conjecture,
but by solid reasons.</p>

<p> Truth is a condition not less necessary in a promissory than
in an affirmatory oath He who promises must be disposed to
perform and fulfil his promise at the appointed time As no
conscientious man will promise to do what he considers opposed to
the most holy Commandments and will of God; so, having promised
and sworn to do what is lawful, he will never fail to adhere to
his engagement, unless, perhaps by a change of circumstances it
should happen that, if he wished to keep faith and observe his
promises, he must incur the displeasure and enmity of God That
truth is necessary to an oath David also declares in these words:
He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Condition: Judgment</h3>

<p>The second condition of an oath is judgment. An oath is not to
be taken rashly and inconsiderately, but after deliberation and
reflection. When about to take an oath, therefore, one should
first consider whether he is obliged to take it, and should weigh
well the whole case, reflecting whether it seems to call for an
oath. Many other circumstances of time, place, etc., are also to
be taken into consideration; and one should not be influenced by
love or hatred, or any other passion, but by the nature and
necessity of the case.</p>

<p> Unless this careful consideration and reflection precede, an
oath must be rash and hasty; and of this character are the
irreligious affirmations of those, who, on the most unimportant
and trifling occasions, swear without thought or reason from the
influence of bad habit alone. This we see practiced daily
everywhere among buyers and sellers. The latter, to sell at the
highest price, the former to purchase at the cheapest rate, make
no scruple to strengthen with an oath their praise or dispraise
of the goods on sale.</p>

<p> Since, therefore, judgment and prudence are necessary, and
since children are not able, on account of their tender years, to
understand and judge accurately, Pope St. Cornelius decreed that
an oath should not be administered to children before puberty,
that is, before their fourteenth year.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Third Condition: Justice</h3>

<p>The last condition (of an oath) is justice, which is
especially requisite in promissory oaths. Hence, if a person
swear to do what is unjust or unlawful, he sins by taking the
oath, and adds sin to sin by executing his promise. Of this the
Gospel supplies an example. King Herod, bound by a rash oath,
gave to a dancing girl the head of John the Baptist as a reward
for her dancing. Such was also the oath taken by the Jews, who,
as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, bound themselves by oath
not to eat, until they had killed Paul.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Lawfulness Of Oaths</h3>

<p>These explanations having been given, there can be no doubt
that they who observe the above conditions and who guard their
oaths with these qualities as with bulwarks, may swear with a
safe conscience. </p>

<p> This is easily established by many proofs. For the law of
God, which is pure and holy, commands: Thou shalt fear the Lord
thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his
name. All they, writes David, shall be praised that swear by him.</p>

<p> The Scriptures also inform us that the most holy Apostles,
the lights of the Church, sometimes made use of oaths, as appears
from the Epistles of the Apostle.</p>

<p> Even the Angels sometimes swear. The angel, writes St. John
in the Apocalypse, swore by him who lives for ever.</p>

<p> Nay, God Himself, the Lord of Angels, swears, and, as we read
in many passages of the Old Testament, has confirmed His.
promises with an oath. This He did to Abraham and to David. Of
the oath sworn by God David says: The Lord hath sworn, and he
will not repent: thou art a priest for ever according to the
order of Melchisedech. </p>

<p> In fact, if we consider the whole matter attentively, and
examine the origin and purpose of an oath, it can be no difficult
matter to explain the reasons why it is a laudable act.</p>

<p> An oath has its origin in faith, by which men believe God to
be the author of all truth, who can never deceive others nor be
deceived, to whose eyes all things are naked and open, who, in
fine, superintends all human affairs with an admirable
providence, and governs the world. Filled with this faith we
appeal to God as a witness of the truth, as a witness whom it
would be wicked and impious to distrust.</p>

<p> With regard to the end of an oath, its scope and intent is to
establish the justice and innocence of man, and to terminate
disputes and contests. This is the doctrine of the Apostle in his
Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>An Objection Against Oaths</h3>

<p>Nor does this doctrine at all clash with these words of the
Redeemer, recorded in St. Matthew: You have heard that it was
said to them of old: &quot;Thou shalt not foreswear thyself, but
thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord&quot;; but I say to you
not to swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of
God; neither by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by
Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king; neither shalt
thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair
white or black. But let your speech be &quot;yea, yea&quot;;
&quot;no, no&quot;; and that which is over and above these is of
evil.</p>

<p> It cannot be asserted that these words condemn oaths
universally and under all circumstances, since we have already
seen that the Apostles and our Lord Himself made frequent use of
them. The object of our Lord was rather to reprove the perverse
opinion of the Jews, who had persuaded themselves that the only
thing to be avoided in an oath was a lie. Hence in matters the
most trivial and unimportant they did not hesitate to make
frequent use of oaths, and to exact them from others. This
practice the Redeemer condemns and reprobates, and teaches that
an oath is never to be taken unless necessity require it. For
oaths have been instituted on account of human frailty. They are
really the outcome of evil, being a sign either of the
inconstancy of him who takes them, or of the obstinacy of him who
refuses to believe without them. However, an oath can be
justified by necessity. </p>

<p> When our Lord says: Let your speech be &quot;yea, yea&quot;;
&quot;no, no,&quot; He evidently forbids the habit of swearing in
familiar conversation and on trivial matters. He therefore
admonishes us particularly against being too ready and willing to
swear; and this should be carefully explained and impressed on
the minds of the faithful. That countless evils grow out of the
unrestrained habit of swearing is proved by the evidence of
Scripture, and the testimony of the most holy Fathers. Thus we
read in Ecclesiasticus: Let not thy mouth be accustomed to
swearing, for in it there are many falls; and again: A man that
sweareth much shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall
not depart from his house. In the works of St. Basil and St.
Augustine against lying, much more can be found on this subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Negative Part of this Commandment</h3>

<p>So far we have considered what this Commandment requires. It
now remains to speak of what it prohibits; namely, to take the
name of God in vain. It is clear that he who swears rashly and
without deliberation commits a grave sin. That this is a most
serious sin is declared by the words: Thou shalt not take the
name of thy God in vain, which seem to assign the reason why this
crime is so wicked and heinous; namely, that it derogates from
the majesty of Him whom we profess to recognise as our Lord and
our God. This Commandment, therefore, forbids to swear falsely,
because he who does not shrink from so great a crime as to appeal
to God to witness falsehood, offers a grievous Injury to God,
charging Him either with ignorance, as though the truth of any
matter could be unknown to Him, or with malice and dishonesty, as
though God could bear testimony to falsehood.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Various Ways In Which Cod's Name Is Dishonoured:
False Oaths </h3>

<p>Among false swearers are to be numbered not only those who
affirm as true what they know to be false, but also those who
swear to what is really true, believing it to be false. For since
the essence of a lie consists in speaking contrary to one's
belief and conviction, these persons are evidently guilty of a
lie, and of perjury.</p>

<p> On the same principle, he who swears to that which he thinks
to be true, but which is really false, also incurs the guilt of
perjury, unless he has used proper care and diligence to arrive
at a full knowledge of the matter. Although he­swears according
to his belief, he nevertheless sins against this Commandment. </p>

<p> Again, he who binds himself by oath to the performance of
anything, not intending to fulfil his promise, or, having had the
intention, neglect its performance, guilty of the same sin. This
equally applies to those who, having bound themselves to God by
vow, neglect its fulfilment.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Unjust Oaths</h3>

<p>This Commandment is also violated, if justice, which is one of
the three conditions of an oath, be wanting. Hence he who swears
to commit a mortal sin, for example, to perpetrate murder,
violates this Commandment, even though he speak seriously and
from his heart, and his oath possess what we before pointed out
as the first condition of every oath, that is, truth.</p>

<p> To these are to be added oaths sworn through a sort of
contempt, such as an oath not to observe the Evangelical
counsels, such as celibacy and poverty. None, it is true, are
obliged to embrace these divine counsels, but by swearing not to
observe them, one contemns and despises them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Rash Oaths</h3>

<p>This Commandment is also sinned against, and judgment is
violated when one swears to what is true and what he believes to
be true if his motives are light conjectures and far­fetched
reasons. For, notwithstanding its truth, such an oath is not
unmixed with a sort of falsehood, seeing that he who swears with
such indifference exposes himself to extreme danger of perjury.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Oaths By False Gods</h3>

<p>To swear by false gods is likewise to swear falsely. What more
opposed to truth than to appeal to lying and false deities as to
the true God?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Irreverent Speech</h3>

<p>Scripture when it prohibits perjury, says: Thou shalt not
profane the name of thy God, thereby forbidding all irreverence
towards all other things to which, in accordance with this
Commandment, reverence is due. Of this nature is the Word of God,
the majesty of which has been revered not only by the pious, but
also sometimes by the impious, as is narrated in Judges of Eglon,
King of the Moabites.</p>

<p> But he who, to support heresy and the teaching of the wicked.
distorts the Sacred Scriptures from their genuine and true
meaning, is guilty of the greatest injury to the Word of God; and
against this crime we are warned by these words of the Prince of
the Apostles: There are certain things hard to be understood.
which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
Scriptures, to their own destruction.</p>

<p> It is also a foul and shameful contamination of the
Scripture, that wicked men pervert the words and sentences which
it contains, and which should be honoured with all reverence,
turning them to profane purposes, such as scurrility, fable,
vanity, flattery, detraction, divination, satire and the like
­­ crimes which the Council of Trent commands to be severely
punished. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Neglect Of Prayer</h3>

<p>In the next place, as they honour God who, in their affliction
implore His help, so they, who do not invoke His aid, deny Him
due honour; and these David rebukes when he says: They have not
called upon the Lord, they trembled for fear where there was no
fear.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Blasphemy</h3>

<p>Still more enormous is the guilt of those who, with impure and
defiled lips, dare to curse or blaspheme the holy name of
God­that name which is to be blessed and praised above measure
by all creatures, or even the names of the Saints who reign with
Him in glory.' So atrocious and horrible is this crime that the
Sacred Scriptures, sometimes when speaking of blasphemy use the
word blessing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sanction of this Commandment</h3>

<p>As, however, the dread of punishment has often a powerful
effect in checking the tendency to sin, the pastor, in order the
more effectively to move the minds of men and the more easily to
induce to an observance of this Commandment, should diligently
explain the remaining words, which are, as it were, its appendix:
For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name
of the Lord his God in vain.</p>

<p> In the first place (the pastor) should teach that with very
good reason has God joined threats to this Commandment. From this
is understood both the grievousness of sin and the goodness of
God toward us, since far from rejoicing in man's destruction, He
deters us by these salutary threats from incurring His anger,
doubtless in order that we may experience His kindness rather
than His wrath. The pastor should urge and insist on this
consideration with greatest earnestness. in order that the
faithful may be made sensible of the grievousness of the crime,
may detest it still more, and may employ increased care and
caution to avoid its commission. </p>

<p> He should also observe how prone men are to this sin, since
it was not sufficient to give the command, but also necessary to
accompany it with threats. The advantages to be derived from this
thought are indeed incredible; for as nothing is more injurious
than a listless security, so the knowledge of our own weakness is
most profitable.</p>

<p> He should next show that God has appointed no particular
punishment. The threat is general; it declares that whoever is
guilty of this crime shall not escape unpunished. The various
chastisements, therefore, with which we are every day visited,
should warn us against this sin. It is easy to conjecture that
men are afflicted with heavy calamities because they violate this
Commandment; and if these things are called to their attention,
it is likely that they will be more careful for the future.</p>

<p> Deterred, therefore, by a holy dread, the faithful should use
every exertion to avoid this sin. If for every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall render an account on the day of judgment,
what shall we say of those heinous crimes which involve great
contempt of the divine name?</p>
