<h3><center>ARTICLE X : &quot;THE FORGIVENESS OF
SINS&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>The enumeration of this among the other Articles of the Creed
is alone sufficient to satisfy us that it conveys a truth, which
is not only in itself a divine mystery, but also a mystery very
necessary to salvation. We have already said that, without a firm
belief of all the Articles of the Creed, Christian piety is
wholly unattainable. However, should that which ought to be clear
in itself seem to require the support of some authority, the
declaration of our Lord will suffice. A short time previous to
His Ascension into heaven, when opening the understanding of His
disciples that they might understand the Scriptures, He bore
testimony to this Article of the Creed, in these words: It
behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the
third day, and that penance and remission of sins should be
preached, in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>

<p> Let the pastor but weigh well these words, and he will
readily perceive that the Lord has placed him under a most sacred
obligation, not only of making known to the faithful whatever
regards religion in general, but also of explaining with
particular care this Article of the Creed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Church Has the Power of Forgiving Sins</h3>

<p>On this point of doctrine, then, it is the duty of the pastor
to teach that, not only is forgiveness of sins to be found in the
Catholic Church, as Isaias had foretold in these words: The
people that dwell therein shall have their iniquity taken away
from them; but also that in her resides the power of forgiving
sins; and furthermore that we are bound to believe that this
power, if exercised duly, and according to the laws prescribed by
our Lord, is such as truly to pardon and remit sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Extent of this Power:</h3>

<h6>All Sins That Precede Baptism</h6>

<p> When we first make a profession of faith and are cleansed in
holy Baptism, we receive this pardon entire and unqualified; so
that no sin, original or actual, of commission or omission, re
mains to be expiated, no punishment to be endured. The grace of
Baptism, however, does not give exemption from all the
infirmities of nature. On the contrary, contending, as each of us
has to contend, against the motions of concupiscence, which ever
tempts us to the commission of sin, there is scarcely one to be
found among us, who opposes so vigorous a resistance to its
assaults, or who guards his salvation so vigilantly, as to escape
all wounds.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>All Sins Committed After Baptism</h6>

<p> It being necessary, therefore, that a power of forgiving
sins, distinct from that of Baptism, should exist in the Church,
to her were entrusted the keys of the kingdom of heaven, by which
each one, if penitent, may obtain the remission of his sins, even
though he were a sinner to the last day of his life. This truth
is vouched for by the most unquestionable authority of the Sacred
Scriptures. In St. Matthew the Lord says to Peter: I will give to
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt
bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven; and
again: Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also
in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be
loosed also in heaven.' Further, the testimony of St. John
assures us that the Lord, breathing on the Apostles, said:
Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive they are
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are
retained. '</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Limitation of this Power:</h6>

<p> </p>

<h6>It Is Not Limited As To Sins, Persons, Or Time </h6>

<p> Nor is the exercise of this power restricted to particular
sins. No crime, however heinous, can be committed or even
conceived which the Church has not power to forgive, just as
there is no sinner, however abandoned, however depraved, who
should not confidently hope for pardon, provided he sincerely
repent of his past transgressions. </p>

<p> Furthermore, the exercise of this power is not restricted to
particular times. Whenever the sinner turns from his evil ways he
is not to be rejected, as we learn from the reply of our Saviour
to the Prince of the Apostles. When St. Peter asked how often we
should pardon an offending brother, whether seven times, Not only
seven times, said the Redeemer, but till seventy times seven. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>It Is Limited As To Its Ministers And Exercise </h6>

<p> But if we look to its ministers, or to the manner in which it
is to be exercised, the extent of this divine power will not
appear so great; for our Lord gave not the power of so sacred a
ministry to all, but to Bishops and priests only. The same must
be said regarding the manner in which this power is to be
exercised; for sins can be forgiven only through the Sacraments,
when duly administered. The Church has received no power
otherwise to remit sin. Hence it follows that in the forgiveness
of sins both priests and Sacraments are, so to speak, the
instruments which Christ our Lord, the author and giver of
salvation, makes use of, to accomplish in us the pardon of sin
and the grace of justification.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Greatness of this Power</h3>

<p>To raise the admiration of the faithful for this heavenly
gift, bestowed on the Church by God's singular mercy towards us,
and to make them approach its use with the more lively sentiments
of devotion the pastor should endeavour to point out the dignity
and the extent of the grace which it imparts. If there be any one
means better calculated than another to accomplish this end, it
is carefully to show how great must be the efficacy of that which
absolves from sin and restores the unjust to a state of
justification.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sin Can Be Forgiven Only By The Power Of God </h3>

<p>This is manifestly an effect of the infinite power of God, of
that same power which we believe to have been necessary to raise
the dead to life and to summon creation into existence. But if it
be true, as the authority of St. Augustine assures us it is, that
to recall a sinner from the state of sin to that of righteousness
is even a greater work than to create the heavens and the earth
from nothing, though their creation can be no other than the
effect of infinite power, it follows that we have still stronger
reason to consider the remission of sins as an effect proceeding
from the exercise of this same infinite power.</p>

<p> With great truth, therefore, have the ancient Fathers
declared that God alone can forgive sins, and that to His
infinite goodness and power alone is so wonderful a work to be
referred. I am he, says the Lord Himself, by the mouth of His
Prophet, I am he who blotteth out your iniquities.</p>

<p> The remission of sins seems to bear an exact analogy to the
cancelling of a pecuniary debt. None but the creditor can forgive
a pecuniary debt. Hence, since by sin we contract a debt to God
alone ­­ wherefore we daily pray: forgive us our debts sin, it
is clear, can be forgiven by Him alone, and by none else.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>This Power Communicated To None Before Christ </h3>

<p>This wonderful and divine power was never communicated to
creatures, until God became man. Christ our Saviour, although
true God, was the first one who, as man, received this high
prerogative from His heavenly Father. That you may know that the
son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then said he to
the man sick of the palsy), rise. take up thy bed, and go into
thy house. As, therefore, He became man, in order to bestow on
man this forgiveness of sins, He communicated this power to
Bishops and priests in the Church, previous to His Ascension into
heaven, where He sits forever at the right hand of God. Christ,
however, as we have already said, remits sin by virtue of His own
authority; all others, by virtue of His authority delegated to
them as His ministers. </p>

<p> If, therefore, whatever is the effect of infinite power
claims our highest admiration and reverence, we must readily
perceive that this gift, bestowed on the Church by the bounteous
hand of Christ our Lord, is one of inestimable value.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sin Remitted Through The Blood Of Christ</h3>

<p>The manner too, in which God, in the fullness of His paternal
clemency resolved to cancel the sins of the world must powerfully
move the faithful to contemplate the greatness of this blessing.
It was His will that our offences should be expiated by the blood
of His Only­begotten Son; that His Son should voluntarily assume
the imputability of our sins, and suffer a most cruel death, the
just for the unjust, the innocent for the guilty.</p>

<p> When, therefore, we reflect that we were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as gold or silver, but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled, we are
naturally led to conclude that we could have received no gift
more salutary than this power of forgiving sins, which proclaims
the ineffable Providence of God and the excess of His love
towards us. This reflection must produce in all the most abundant
spiritual fruit.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Great Evil From Which Forgiveness Delivers Man</h3>

<p>For whoever offends God, even by one mortal sin, instantly
forfeits whatever merits he may have previously acquired through
the sufferings and death of Christ, and is entirely shut out from
the gate of heaven which, when already closed, was thrown open to
all by the Redeemer's Passion. When we reflect on this, the
thought of our misery must fill us with deep anxiety. But if we
turn our attention to this admirable power with which God has
invested His Church; and, in the firm belief of this Article,
feel convinced that to every sinner is offered the means of
recovering, with the assistance of divine grace, his former
dignity, we must exult with exceeding joy and gladness, and must
offer immortal thanks to God.</p>

<p> If, when we are seriously ill, the medicines prepared for us
by the art and industry of the physician are wont to be welcome
and agreeable to us, how much more welcome and agreeable should
those remedies prove which the wisdom of God has established to
heal our souls and restore us to the life of grace, especially
since they bring with them, not, indeed, uncertain hope of
recovery, like the medicines that are applied to the body, but
assured health to such as desire to be cured !</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Exhortation:</h3>

<h3>This Remedy To Be Used</h3>

<p>The faithful, therefore, having formed a just conception of
the dignity of so excellent and exalted a blessing, should be
exhorted to profit by it to the best of their ability. For he who
makes no use of what is really useful and necessary must be
supposed to despise it; particularly since, in communicating to
the Church the power of forgiving sin, the Lord did so with the
view that all should have recourse to this healing remedy. As
without Baptism no one can be cleansed, so in order to recover
the grace of Baptism, forfeited by actual mortal guilt, recourse
must be had to another means of expiation, ­­ namely, the
Sacrament of Penance. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Abuse To Be Guarded Against</h3>

<p>But here the faithful are to be admonished to guard against
the danger of becoming more prone to sin, or slow to repentance,
from a presumption that they can have recourse to this power of
forgiving sins which is so complete and, as we saw, unrestricted
as to time. For, as such a propensity to sin would manifestly
convict them of acting injuriously and contumaciously to this
divine power, and would therefore render them unworthy of the
divine mercy; so this slowness to repentance gives great reason
to fear that, overtaken by death, they may in vain confess their
belief in the remission of sins, which by their tardiness and
procrastination they deservedly forfeited.</p>
