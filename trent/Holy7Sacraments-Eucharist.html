<h3><center>THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST</center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On The Eucharist</h3>

<p>As of all the sacred mysteries bequeathed to us by our Lord
and Saviour as most infallible instruments of divine grace, there
is none comparable to the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist;
so, for no crime is there a heavier punishment to be feared from
God than for the unholy or irreligious use by the faithful of
that which is full of holiness, or rather which contains the very
author and source of holiness. This the Apostle wisely saw, and
has openly admonished us of it. For when he had declared the
enormity of their guilt who discerned not the body of the Lord,
he immediately subjoined: Therefore are there many infirm and
weak among you, and many sleep.</p>

<p> In order that the faithful, therefore, aware of the divine
honours due to this heavenly Sacrament, may derive therefrom
abundant fruit of grace and escape the most just anger of God,
pastors should explain with the greatest diligence all those
things which may seem calculated more fully to display its
majesty.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Institution of the Eucharist</h3>

<p>In this matter it will be necessary that pastors, following
the example of the Apostle Paul, who professes to have delivered
to the Corinthians what he had received from the Lord, first of
all explain to the faithful the institution of this Sacrament. </p>

<p> That its institution was as follows, is clearly inferred from
the Evangelist. Our Lord, having loved his own, loved them to the
end. As a divine and admirable pledge of this love, knowing that
the hour had now come that He should pass from the world to the
Father, that He­might not ever at any period be absent from His
own, He accomplished with inexplicable wisdom that which
surpasses all the order and condition of nature. For having kept
the supper of the Paschal lamb with His disciples, that the
figure might yield to the reality, the shadow to the substance,
He took bread, and giving thanks unto God, He blessed, and brake,
and gave to the disciples, and said: &quot;Take ye and eat, this
is my body which shall be delivered for you; this do for a
commemoration of me.&quot; In like manner also, He took the
chalice after he had supped, saying: &quot;This chalice is the
new testament in my blood; this do, as often as you shall drink
it, in commemoration of me&quot;.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning of the Word &quot;Eucharist&quot;</h3>

<p>Wherefore sacred writers, seeing that it was not at all
possible that they should manifest by one term the dignity and
excellence of this admirable Sacrament, endeavoured to express it
by many words.</p>

<p> For sometimes they call it Eucharist, which word we may
render either by good grace, or by thanksgiving. And rightly,
indeed, is it to be called good grace, as well because it first
signifies eternal life, concerning which it has been written: The
grace of God is eternal life; and also because it contains Christ
the Lord, who is true grace and the fountain of all favours. </p>

<p> No less aptly do we interpret it thanksgiving; inasmuch as
when we immolate this purest victim, we give daily unbounded
thanks to God for all His kindnesses towards us, and above all
for so excellent a gift of His grace, which He grants to us in
this Sacrament. This same name, also, is fully in keeping with
those things which we read were done by Christ the Lord at the
institution of this mystery. For taking bread he brake it, and
gave thanks. David also, when contemplating the greatness of this
mystery, before he pronounced that song: He hath made a
remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious
Lord, he hath given food to them that fear him, thought that he
should first make this act of thanksgiving: His work is praise
and magnificence. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Names Of This Sacrament</h3>

<p>Frequently, also, it is called Sacrifice. Concerning this
mystery there will be occasion to speak more at length presently.
</p>

<p> It is called, moreover, communion, the term being evidently
borrowed from that passage of the Apostle where we read: The
chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the
partaking of the body of the Lord? For, as Damascene has
explained, this Sacrament unites us to Christ, renders us
partakers of His flesh and Divinity, reconciles and unites us to
one another in the same Christ, and forms us, as it were, into
one body.</p>

<p> Whence it came to pass, that i. was called also the Sacrament
of peace and love. We can understand then how unworthy they are
of the name of Christian who cherish enmities, and how hatred,
dissensions and discord should be entirely put away, as the most
destructive bane of the faithful, especially since by the daily
Sacrifice of our religion, we profess to preserve nothing with
more anxious care, than peace and love.</p>

<p> It is also frequently called the Viaticum by sacred writers,
both because it is spiritual food by which we are sustained in
our pilgrimage through this life, and also because it paves our
way to eternal glory and happiness. Wherefore, according to an
ancient usage of the Catholic Church, we see that none of the
faithful are permitted to die without this Sacrament.</p>

<p> The most ancient Fathers, following the authority of the
Apostle, have sometimes also called the Holy Eucharist by the
name of Supper, because it was instituted by Christ the Lord at
the salutary mystery of the Last Supper.</p>

<p> It is not, however, lawful to consecrate or partake of the
Eucharist after eating or drinking, because, according to a
custom wisely introduced by the Apostles, as ancient writers have
recorded, and which has ever been retained and preserved,
Communion is received only by persons who are fasting.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Is a Sacrament Properly So Called </h3>

<p>The meaning of the name having been explained, it will be
necessary to show that this is a true Sacrament, and one of those
seven which the holy Church has ever revered and venerated
religiously. For when the consecration of the chalice is
effected, it is called a mystery of faith.</p>

<p> Besides, to omit the almost endless testimonies of sacred
writers, who have invariably thought that this was to be numbered
among the real Sacraments, the same thing is proved from the very
principle and nature of a Sacrament. For there are in it signs
that are external and subject to the senses. In the next place it
signifies and produces grace. Moreover, neither the Evangelists
nor the Apostle leave room for doubt regarding its institution by
Christ. Since all these things concur to establish the fact of
the Sacrament, there is obviously no need of any other argument. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>In What Respect The Eucharist Is A Sacrament </h3>

<p>But pastors should carefully observe that in this mystery
there are many things to which sacred writers have from time to
time attributed the name of Sacrament. For, sometimes, both the
consecration and the Communion; nay, frequently also the body and
blood itself of our Lord, which is contained in the Eucharist,
used to be called a Sacrament. Thus St. Augustine says that this
Sacrament consists of two things, ­­ the visible species of the
elements, and the invisible flesh and blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ Himself. And it is in the same sense that we say that this
Sacrament is to be adored, meaning the body and blood of our
Lord.</p>

<p> Now it is plain that all these are less properly called
Sacraments. The species of bread and wine themselves are truly
and strictly designated by this name.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How The Eucharist Differs From All The Other
Sacraments</h3>

<p>How much this Sacrament differs from all the others is easily
inferred. For all the other Sacraments are completed by the use
of the material, that is, while they are being administered to
some one. Thus Baptism. attains the nature of a Sacrament when
the individual is actually being washed in the water. For the
perfecting of the Eucharist on the other hand, the consecration
of the material itself suffices, since neither (species) ceases
to be a Sacrament, though kept in the pyx.</p>

<p> Again in perfecting the other Sacraments there is no change
of the matter and element into another nature. The water of
Baptism, or the oil of Confirmation, when those Sacraments are
being administered, do not lose their former nature of water and
oil; but in the Eucharist, that which was bread and wine before
consecration, after consecration is truly the substance of the
body and blood of the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Is But One Sacrament</h3>

<p>But although there are two elements, as bread and wine, of
which the entire Sacrament of the Eucharist is constituted, yet
guided by the authority of the Church, we confess that this is
not many Sacraments, but only one.</p>

<p> Otherwise, there cannot be the exact number of seven
Sacraments, as has ever been handed down, and as was decreed by
the Councils of Lateran, Florence and Trent.</p>

<p> Moreover, by virtue of the Sacrament, one mystical body is
effected; hence, that the Sacrament itself may correspond to the
thing which it effects, it must be one.</p>

<p> It is one not because it is indivisible, but because it
signifies a single thing. For as food and drink, which are two
different things, are employed only for one purpose, namely, that
the vigour of the body may be recruited; so also it was but
natural that there should be an analogy to them in the two
different species of the Sacrament, which should signify the
spiritual food by which souls are supported and refreshed.
Wherefore we have been assured by our Lord the Saviour: My flesh
is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Signifies Three Things</h3>

<p>It must, therefore, be diligently explained what the Sacrament
of the Eucharist signifies, that the faithful, beholding the
sacred mysteries with their eyes, may also at the same time feed
their souls with the contemplation of divine things. Three
things, then, are signified by this Sacrament. The first is the
Passion of Christ our Lord, a thing past; for He Himself said: Do
this for a commemoration of me, and the Apostle says: As often as
you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show
the death of the Lord, until he come.</p>

<p> It is also significant of divine and heavenly grace, which is
imparted at the present time by this Sacrament to nurture and
preserve the soul. Just as in Baptism we are begotten unto
newness of life and by Confirmation are strengthened to resist
Satan and openly to profess the name of Christ, so by the
Sacrament of the Eucharist are we nurtured and supported.</p>

<p> It is, thirdly, a foreshadowing of future eternal joy and
glory, which, according to God's promises, we shall receive in
our heavenly country.</p>

<p> These three things, then, which are clearly distinguished by
their reference to past, present and future times, are so well
represented by the Eucharistic mysteries that the whole
Sacrament, though consisting of different species, signifies the
three as if it referred to one thing only.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Constituent Parts of the Eucharist</h3>

<h3>The Matter</h3>

<p>It is particularly incumbent on pastors to know the matter of
this Sacrament, in order that they themselves may rightly
consecrate it, and also that they may be able to instruct the
faithful as to its significance, inflaming them with an earnest
desire of that which it signifies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The First Element Of The Eucharist Is Bread</h6>

<p> The matter of this Sacrament is twofold. The first element is
wheaten bread, of which we shall now speak. Of the second we
shall treat hereafter. As the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke
testify, Christ the Lord took bread into His hands, blessed, and
brake, saying: This is my body; and, according to John, the same
Saviour called Himself bread in these words: I am the living
bread, that came down from heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Sacramental Bread Must Be Wheaten</h6>

<p> There are, however, various sorts of bread, either because
they consist of different materials, ­­ such as wheat, barley,
pulse and other products of the earth; or because they possess
different qualities, ­­ some being leavened, others altogether
without leaven. It is to be observed that, with regard to the
former kinds, the words of the Saviour show that the bread should
be wheaten; for, according to common usage, when we simply say
bread, we are sufficiently understood to mean wheaten bread. This
is also declared by a figure in the Old Testament, because the
Lord commanded that the loaves of proposition, which signified
this Sacrament, should be made of fine flour.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Sacramental Bread Should Be Unleavened</h6>

<p> But as wheaten bread alone is to be considered the proper
matter for this Sacrament ­­ a doctrine which has been handed
down by Apostolic tradition and confirmed by the authority of the
Catholic Church ­­ so it may be easily inferred from the doings
of Christ the Lord that this bread should be unleavened. It was
consecrated and instituted by Him on the first day of unleavened
bread, on which it was not lawful for the Jews to have anything
leavened in their house.</p>

<p> Should the authority of John the Evangelist, who says that
all this was done before the feast of the Passover, be objected
to, the argument is one of easy solution. For by the day before
the pasch John understands the same day which the other
Evangelists designate as the first day of unleavened bread. He
wished particularly to mark the natural day, which commences at
sunrise; whereas they wanted to point out that our Lord
celebrated the Pasch on Thursday evening just when the days of
the unleavened bread were beginning. Hence St. Chrysostom also
understands the first day of unleavened bread to be the day on
the evening of which unleavened bread was to be eaten.</p>

<p> The peculiar suitableness of the consecration of unleavened
bread to express that integrity and purity of mind which the
faithful should bring to this Sacrament we learn from these words
of the Apostle: Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new
paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover is
sacrificed. Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor
with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened
bread of sincerity and truth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Unleavened Bread Not Essential</h6>

<p> This quality of the bread, however, is not to be deemed so
essential that, if it be wanting, the Sacrament cannot exist; for
both kinds are called by the one name and have the true and
proper nature of bread. No one, however, is at liberty on his own
private authority, or rather presumption, to transgress the
laudable rite of his Church. And such departure is the less
warrantable in priests of the Latin Church, expressly obliged as
they are by the supreme Pontiffs, to consecrate the sacred
mysteries with unleavened bread only.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Quantity Of The Bread</h6>

<p> With regard to the first matter of this Sacrament, let this
exposition suffice. It is, however, to be observed, that the
quantity of the matter to be consecrated is not defined, since we
cannot define the exact number of those who can or ought to
receive the sacred mysteries.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Second Element Of The Eucharist Is Wine</h6>

<p> It remains for us to treat of the other matter and element of
this Sacrament, which is wine pressed from the fruit of the vine,
with which is mingled a little water.</p>

<p> That in the institution of this Sacrament our Lord and
Saviour made use of wine has beep at all times the doctrine of
the Catholic Church, for He Himself said: I will not drink from
henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day. On this
passage Chrysostom observes: He says, &quot;Of the fruit of the
vine,&quot; which certainly produced wine not water; as if he had
it in view, even at so early a period, to uproot the heresy which
asserted that in these mysteries water alone is to be used. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Water Should Be Mixed With The Wine</h6>

<p> With the wine, however, the Church of God has always mingled
water. First, because Christ the Lord did so, as is proved by the
authority of Councils and the testimony of St. Cyprian; next,
because by this mixture is renewed the recollection of the blood
and water that issued from His side. Waters, also, as we read in
the Apocalypse, signify the people; and hence, water mixed with
the wine signifies the union of the faithful with Christ their
Head. This rite, derived as it is from Apostolic tradition, the
Catholic Church has always observed.</p>

<p> But although there are reasons so grave for mingling water
with the wine that it cannot be omitted without incurring the
guilt of mortal sin, yet its omission does not render the
Sacrament null.</p>

<p> Again as in the sacred mysteries priests must be mindful to
mingle water with wine, so, also, must they take care to mingle
it in small quantity, for, in the opinion and judgment of
ecclesiastical writers, that water is changed into wine. Hence
these words of Pope Honorius on the subject: A pernicious abuse
has prevailed in your district of using in the sacrifice a
greater quantity of water than of wine; whereas, according to the
rational practice of the universal Church, the wine should be
used in much greater quantity than the water.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>No Other Elements Pertain To This Sacrament</h6>

<p> These, then, are the only two elements of this Sacrament; and
with reason has it been enacted by many decrees that, although
there have been those who were not afraid to do so, it is
unlawful to offer anything but bread and wine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Peculiar Fitness Of Bread And Wine</h6>

<p> We have now to consider the aptitude of these two symbols of
bread and wine to represent those things of which we believe and
confess they are the sensible signs.</p>

<p> In the first place, then, they signify to us Christ, as the
true life of men; for our Lord Himself says: My flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. As, then, the body of
Christ the Lord furnishes nourishment unto eternal life to those
who receive this Sacrament with purity and holiness, rightly is
the matter composed chiefly of those elements by which our
present life is sustained, in order that the faithful may easily
understand that the mind and soul are satiated by the Communion
of the precious body and blood of Christ.</p>

<p> These very elements serve also somewhat to suggest to men the
truth of the Real Presence of the body and blood of the Lord in
the Sacrament. Observing, as we do, that bread and wine are every
day changed by the power of nature into human flesh and blood, we
are led the more easily by this analogy to believe that the
substance of the bread and wine is changed, by the heavenly
benediction, into the real flesh and real blood of Christ.</p>

<p> This admirable change of the elements also helps to shadow
forth what takes place in the soul. Although no change of the
bread and wine appears externally, yet their substance is truly
changed into the flesh and blood of Christ; so, in like manner,
although in us nothing appears changed, yet we are renewed
inwardly unto life, when we receive in the Sacrament of the
Eucharist the true life.</p>

<p> Moreover, the body of the Church, which is one, consists of
many members, and of this union nothing is more strikingly
illustrative than the elements of bread and wine; for bread is
made from many grains and wine is pressed from many clusters of
grapes. Thus they signify that we, though many, are most closely
bound together by the bond of this divine mystery and made, as it
were, one body.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Form Of The Eucharist</h3>

<p>The form to be used in the consecration of the bread is next
to be treated of, not, however, in order that the faithful should
be taught these mysteries, unless necessity require it; for this
knowledge is not needful for those who have not received Holy
Orders. The purpose (of this section) is to guard against most
shameful mistakes on the part of priests, at the time of the
consecration, due to ignorance of the form.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Form To Be Used In The Consecration Of The Bread </h6>

<p> We are then taught by the holy Evangelists, Matthew and Luke,
and also by the Apostle, that the form consists of these words:
This is my body; for it is written: Whilst they were at supper,
Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to his
disciples, and said: Take and eat, This is my body.</p>

<p> This form of consecration having been observed by Christ the
Lord has been always used by the Catholic Church. The testimonies
of the Fathers, the enumeration of which would be endless, and
also the decree of the Council of Florence, which is well known
and accessible to all, must here be omitted, especially as the
knowledge which they convey may be obtained from these words of
the Saviour: Do this for a commemoration of me. For what the Lord
enjoined was not only what He had done, but also what he had
said; and especially is this true, since the words were uttered
not only to signify, but also to accomplish.</p>

<p> That these words constitute the form is easily proved from
reason also. The form is that which signifies what is
accomplished in this Sacrament; but as the preceding words
signify and declare what takes place in the Eucharist, that is,
the conversion of the bread into the true body of our Lord, it
therefore follows that these very words constitute the form. In
this sense may be understood the words of the Evangelist: He
blessed; for they seem equivalent to this: Taking bread, he
blessed it, saying: &quot;This is my body&quot;.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Not All The Words Used Are Essential</h6>

<p> Although in the Evangelist the words, Take and eat, precede
the words (This is my body), they evidently express the use only,
not the consecration, of the matter. Wherefore, while they are
not necessary to the consecration of the Sacrament, they are by
all means to be pronounced by the priest, as is also the
conjunction for in the consecration of the body and blood. But
they are not necessary to the validity of the Sacrament,
otherwise it would follow that, if this Sacrament were not to be
administered to anyone, it should not, or indeed could not, be
consecrated; whereas, no one can lawfully doubt that the priest,
by pronouncing the words of our Lord according to the institution
and practice of the Church, truly consecrates the proper matter
of the bread, even though it should afterwards never be
administered.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Form To Be Used In The Consecration Of The Wine </h6>

<p> With regard lo the consecration of the wine, which is the
other element of this Sacrament, the priest, for the reason we
have already assigned, ought of necessity to be well acquainted
with, and well understand its form. We are then firmly to believe
that it consists in the following words: This is the chalice of
my blood, of the new and eternal testament, the mystery of faith,
which shall be shed for you and for many, to the remission of
sins. Of these words the greater part are taken from Scripture;
but some have been preserved in the Church from Apostolic
tradition. </p>

<p> Thus the words, this is the chalice, are found in St. Luke
and in the Apostle; but the words that immediately follow, of my
blood, or my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for
you and for many to the remission of sins, are found partly in
St. Luke and partly in St. Matthew. But the words, eternal, and
the mystery of faith, have been taught us by holy tradition, the
interpreter and keeper of Catholic truth.</p>

<p> Concerning this form no one can doubt, if he here also attend
to what has been already said about the form used in the
consecration of the bread. The form to be used (in the
consecration) of this element, evidently consists of those words
which signify that the substance of the wine is changed into the
blood of our Lord. since, therefore, the words already cited
clearly declare this, it is plain that no other words constitute
the form. </p>

<p> They moreover express certain admirable fruits of the blood
shed in the Passion of our Lord, fruits which pertain in a most
special manner to this Sacrament. Of these, one is access to the
eternal inheritance, which has come to us by right of the new and
everlasting testament. Another is access to righteousness by the
mystery of faith; for God hath set forth Jesus to be a
propitiator through faith in his blood, that he himself may be
just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus.
Christ. A third effect is the remission of sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Explanation Of The Form Used In The Consecration Of The Wine </h6>

<p> Since these very words of consecration are replete with
mysteries and most appropriately suitable to the subject, they
demand a more minute consideration.</p>

<p> The words: This is the chalice of my blood, are to be
understood to mean: This is my blood, which is contained in this
chalice. The mention of the chalice made at the consecration of
the blood is right and appropriate, inasmuch as the blood is the
drink of the faithful, and this would not be sufficiently
signified if it were not contained in some drinking vessel.</p>

<p> Next follow the words: Of the new testament. These have been
added that we might understand the blood of Christ the Lord to be
given not under a figure, as was done in the Old Law, of which we
read in the Epistle to the Hebrews that without blood a testament
is not dedicated; but to be given to men in truth and in reality,
as becomes the New Testament. Hence the Apostle says: Christ
therefore is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of
his death, they who are called may receive the promise of eternal
inheritance.</p>

<p> The word eternal refers to the eternal inheritance, the right
to which we acquire by the death of Christ the Lord, the eternal
testator.</p>

<p> The words mystery of faith, which are subjoined, do not
exclude the reality, but signify that what lies hidden and
concealed and far removed from the perception of the eye, is to
be believed with firm faith. In this passage, however, these
words bear a meaning different from that which they have when
applied also to Baptism. Here the mystery of faith consists in
seeing by faith the blood of Christ veiled under the species of
wine; but Baptism is justly called by us the Sacrament of faith,
by the Greeks, the mystery of faith, because it embraces the
entire profession of the Christian faith.</p>

<p> Another reason why we call the blood of the Lord the mystery
of faith is that human reason is particularly beset with
difficulty and embarrassment when faith proposes to our belief
that Christ the Lord, the true Son of God, at once God and man,
suffered death for us, and this death is designated by the
Sacrament of His blood.</p>

<p> Here, therefore, rather than at the consecration of His body,
is appropriately commemorated the Passion of our Lord, by the
words. which shall be shed for the remission of sins. For the
blood, separately consecrated, serves to place before the eyes of
all, in a more forcible manner, the Passion of our Lord, His
death, and the nature of His sufferings.</p>

<p> The additional words for you and for many, are taken, some
from Matthew, some from Luke, but were joined together by the
Catholic Church under the guidance of the Spirit of God. They
serve to declare the fruit and advantage of His Passion. For if
we look to its value, we must confess that the Redeemer shed His
blood for the salvation of all; but if we look to the fruit which
mankind have received from it, we shall easily find that it
pertains not unto all, but to many of the human race. When
therefore ('our Lord) said: For you, He meant either those who
were present, or those chosen from among the Jewish people, such
as were, with the exception of Judas, the disciples with whom He
was speaking. When He added, And for many, He wished to be
understood to mean the remainder of the elect from among the Jews
or Gentiles.</p>

<p> With reason, therefore, were the words for all not used, as
in this place the fruits of the Passion are alone spoken of, and
to the elect only did His Passion bring the fruit of salvation.
And this is the purport of the Apostle when he says: Christ was
offered once to exhaust the sins of many; and also of the words
of our Lord in John: I pray for them; I pray not for the world,
but for them whom thou hast given me, because they are thine. </p>

<p> Beneath the words of this consecration lie hid many other
mysteries, which by frequent meditation and study of sacred
things, pastors will find it easy, with the divine assistance, to
discover for themselves.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Three Mysteries Of The Eucharist</h3>

<p>We must now return to an explanation of those truths
concerning the Eucharist about which the faithful are on no
account to be left in ignorance. Pastors, aware of the warning of
the Apostle that those who discern not the body of the Lord are
guilty of a most grave crime, should first of all impress on the
minds of the faithful the necessity of detaching, as much as
possible, their mind and understanding from the dominion of the
senses; for if they believe that this Sacrament contains only
what the senses disclose, they will of necessity fall into
enormous impiety. Consulting the sight, the touch, the smell, the
taste and finding nothing but the appearances of bread and wine,
they will naturally judge that this Sacrament contains nothing
more than bread and wine. Their minds, therefore, are as much as
possible to be withdrawn from subjection to the senses and
excited to the contemplation of the stupendous might and power of
God.</p>

<p> The Catholic Church firmly believes and professes that in
this Sacrament the words of consecration accomplish three
wondrous and admirable effects.</p>

<p> The first is that the true body of Christ the Lord, the same
that was born of the Virgin, and is now seated at the right hand
of the Father in heaven, is contained in this Sacrament. </p>

<p> The second, however repugnant it may appear to the senses, is
that none of the substance of the elements remains in the
Sacrament.</p>

<p> The third, which may be deduced from the two preceding.
although the words of consecration themselves clearly express it,
is that the accidents which present themselves to the eyes or
other senses exist in a wonderful and ineffable manner without a
subject. All the accidents of bread and wine we can see, but they
inhere in no substance, and exist independently of any; for the
substance of the bread and wine is so changed into the body and
blood of our Lord that they altogether cease to be the substance
of bread and wine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Real Presence</h3>

<p>To begin with the first (of these mysteries), pastors should
give their best attention to show how clear and explicit are the
words of our Saviour which establish the Real Presence of His
body in this Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From Scripture</h6>

<p> When our Lord says: This is my body, this is my blood, no
person of sound mind can mistake His meaning, particularly since
there is reference to Christ's human nature, the reality of which
the Catholic faith permits no one to doubt. The admirable words
of St. Hilary, a man not less eminent for piety than learning,
are apt here: When our Lord himself declares, as our faith
teaches us, that His flesh is food indeed, what room can remain
for doubt concerning the real presence of His body and blood?</p>

<p> Pastors should also adduce another passage from which it can
be clearly seen that the true body and blood of our Lord are
contained in the Eucharist. The Apostle, after having recorded
the consecration of bread and wine by our Lord, and also the
administration of Communion to the Apostles, adds: But let a man
prove himself, and so eat of that bread and drink of the chalice;
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. If, as
heretics continually repeat, the Sacrament presents nothing to
our veneration but a memorial and sign of the Passion of Christ,
why was there need to exhort the faithful, in language so
energetic, to prove themselves? By the terrible word judgment,
the Apostle shows how enormous is the guilt of those who receive
unworthily and do not distinguish from common food the body of
the Lord concealed in the Eucharist. In the same Epistle St. Paul
had already developed this doctrine more fully, when he said: The
chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of Christ? and the bread which we break, is it not the
participation of the body of the Lord ? Now these words signify
the real substance of the body and blood of Christ the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Teaching Of The Church</h6>

<p> These passages of Scripture are therefore to be expounded by
pastors; and they should especially teach that there is nothing
doubtful or uncertain about them. All the more certain are they
since the infallible teaching of God's Church has interpreted
them, as may be ascertained in a twofold manner.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Testimony Of The Fathers</h6>

<p> The first is by consulting the Fathers who flourished in the
early ages of the Church and in each succeeding century, who are
the most unexceptionable witnesses of her doctrine. All of these
teach in the clearest terms and with the most entire unanimity
the truth of this dogma. To adduce the individual testimony of
each Father would prove an endless task. It is enough, therefore,
that we cite, or rather point out a few, whose testimony will
afford an easy criterion by which to judge of the rest.</p>

<p> Let St. Ambrose first declare his faith. In his book On Those
Who are Initiated Into the Mysteries he says that the true body
of Christ is received in this Sacrament, just as the true body of
Christ was derived from the Virgin, and that this truth is to be
believed with the firm certainty of faith. In another place he
teaches that before consecration there is only bread, but after
consecration there is the flesh of Christ.</p>

<p> St. Chrysostom, another witness of equal authority and
gravity, professes and proclaims this mysterious truth in many
passages, but particularly in his sixtieth homily, On Those Who
Receive The Sacred Mysteries Unworthily; and also in his
forty­fourth and forty­fifth homilies on St. John. Let us, he
says, obey, not contradict God, although what He says may seem
contrary to our reason and our sight. His words cannot deceive,
our senses are easily deceived.</p>

<p> With this doctrine fully agrees the uniform teaching of St.
Augustine, that most zealous defender of Catholic faith,
particularly when in his explanation of the thirty­third Psalm
he says: To carry himself in his own hands is impossible to man,
and peculiar to Christ alone; He was carried in His own hands
when, giving His body to be eaten, He said, This is my body. </p>

<p> To pass by Justin and Irenaeus, St. Cyril, in his fourth book
on St. John, declares in such express terms that the true body of
our Lord is contained in this Sacrament, that no sophistry, no
captious interpretations can obscure his meaning. </p>

<p> Should pastors wish for additional testimonies of the
Fathers, they will find it easy to add St. Denis,­ St. Hilary,
St. Jerome, St. Damascene and a host of others, whose weighty
teaching on this most important subject has been collected by the
labor and industry of learned and pious men.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Teaching Of The Councils</h6>

<p> Another means of ascertaining the belief of the holy Church
on matters of faith is the condemnation of the contrary doctrine
and opinion. It is manifest that belief in the Real Presence of
the body of Christ in the holy Sacrament of the Eucharist was so
spread and taught throughout the universal Church and unanimously
professed by all the faithful, that when, five centuries ago,
Berengarius presumed to deny this dogma, asserting that the
Eucharist was only a sign, he was unanimously condemned in the
Council of Vercelli, which Leo IX had immediately convoked,
whereupon he himself anathematised his error.</p>

<p> Relapsing, however, into the same wicked folly, he was
condemned by three different Councils, convened, one at Tours,
the other two at Rome; of the two latter, one was summoned by
Pope Nicholas II, the other by Pope Gregory VIII.' The General
Council of Lateran, held under Innocent III, further ratified the
sentence. Finally this truth was more clearly defined and
established in the Councils of Florence and Trent.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Two Great Benefits Of Proving The Real Presence </h6>

<p> If, then, pastors will carefully explain these particulars,
they will be able, while ignoring those who are blinded by error
and hate nothing more than the light of truth, to strengthen the
weak and administer joy and consolation to the pious, all the
more as the faithful cannot doubt that this dogma is numbered
among the Articles of faith.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Faith Is Strengthened</h6>

<p> Believing and confessing, as they do, that the power of God
is supreme over all things, they must also believe that His
omnipotence can accomplish the great work which we admire and
adore in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. And again since they
believe the Holy Catholic Church, they must necessarily believe
that the true doctrine of this Sacrament is that which we have
set forth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Soul Is Gladdened</h6>

<p> Nothing contributes more to the spiritual joy and advantage
of pious persons than the contemplation of the exalted dignity of
this most august Sacrament. In the first place they learn how
great is the perfection of the Gospel Dispensation, under which
we enjoy the reality of that which under the Mosaic Law was only
shadowed forth by types and figures. Hence St. Denis divinely
says that our Church is midway between the Synagogue and the
heavenly Jerusalem, and consequently participates of the nature
of both. Certainly, then, the faithful can never sufficiently
admire the perfection of holy Church and her exalted glory which
seems to be removed only by one degree from the bliss of heaven.
In common with the inhabitants of heaven, we too possess Christ,
God and man, present with us. They are raised a degree above us,
inasmuch as they are present with Christ and enjoy the Beatific
Vision; while we, with a firm and unwavering faith, adore the
Divine Majesty present with us, not, it is true, in a manner
visible to mortal eye, but hidden by a miracle of power under the
veil of the sacred mysteries.</p>

<p> Furthermore the faithful experience in this Sacrament the
most perfect love of Christ our Saviour. It became the goodness
of the Saviour not to withdraw from us that nature which He
assumed from us, but to desire, as far as possible, to remain
among us so that at all times He might be seen to verify the
words: My delight is to be with the children of men.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Meaning of the Real Presence</h6>

<p> </p>

<h6>Christ Whole And Entire Is Present In The Eucharist </h6>

<p> Here the pastor should explain that in this Sacrament are
contained not only the true body of. Christ and all the
constituents of a true body, such as bones and sinews, but also
Christ whole and entire. He should point out that the word Christ
designates the God­man, that is to say, one Person in whom are
united the divine and human natures; that the Holy Eucharist,
therefore, contains both, and whatever is included in the idea of
both, the Divinity and humanity whole and entire, consisting of
the soul, all the parts of the body and the blood,­ all of which
must be believed to be in this Sacrament. In heaven the whole
humanity is united to the Divinity in one hypostasis, or Person;
hence it would be impious, to suppose that the body of Christ,
which is contained in the Sacrament, is separated from His
Divinity. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Presence In Virtue Of The Sacrament And In Virtue Of
Concomitance </h6>

<p> Pastors, however, should not fail to observe that in this
Sacrament not all these things are contained after the same
manner, or by the same power. Some things, we say, are present in
virtue of the consecration; for as the words of consecration
effect what they signify, sacred writers usually say that
whatever the form expresses, is contained in the Sacrament by
virtue of the Sacrament. Hence, could we suppose any one thing to
be entirely separated from the rest, the Sacrament, they teach,
would be found to contain solely what the form expresses and
nothing more.</p>

<p> On the other hand, some things are contained in the Sacrament
because they are united to those which are expressed in the form.
For instance, the words This is my body, which comprise the form
used to consecrate the bread, signify the body of the Lord, and
hence the body itself of Christ the Lord is contained in the
Eucharist by virtue of the Sacrament. Since, however, to Christ's
body are united His blood, His soul, and His Divinity, all of
these also must be found to coexist in the Sacrament; not,
however, by virtue of the consecration, but by virtue of the
union that subsists between them and His body. All these are said
to be in the Eucharist by virtue of concomitance. Hence it is
clear that Christ, whole and entire, is contained in the
Sacrament; for when two things are actually united, where one is,
the other must also be.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Christ Whole And Entire Present Under Each Species </h6>

<p> Hence it also follows that Christ is so contained, whole and
entire, under either species, that, as under the species of bread
are contained not only the body, but also the blood and Christ
entire; so in like manner, under the species of wine are truly
contained not only the blood, but also the body and Christ
entire.</p>

<p> But although these are matters on which the faithful cannot
entertain a doubt, it was nevertheless wisely ordained that two
distinct consecrations should take place. First, because they
represent in a more lively manner the Passion of our Lord, in
­which His blood was separated from His body; and hence in the
form of consecration we commemorate the shedding of His blood.
Secondly, since the Sacrament is to be used by us as the food and
nourishment of our souls, it was most appropriate that it should
be instituted as food and drink, two things which obviously
constitute the complete sustenance of the (human) body.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Christ Whole And Entire Present In Every Part Of Each Species
</h6>

<p> Nor should it be forgotten that Christ, whole and entire, is
contained not only under either species, but also in each
particle of either species. Each, says St. Augustine, receives
Christ the Lord, and He is entire in each portion. He is not
diminished by being given to many, but gives Himself whole and
entire to each.</p>

<p> This is also an obvious inference from the narrative of the
Evangelists. It is not to be supposed that our Lord consecrated
the bread used at the Last Supper in separate parts, applying the
form particularly to each, but that all the bread then used for
the sacred mysteries was consecrated at the same time and with
the same form, and in a quantity sufficient for all the Apostles.
That the consecration of the chalice was performed in this
manner, is clear from these words of the Saviour: Take and divide
it among you.</p>

<p> What has hitherto been said is intended to enable pastors to
show that the true body and blood of Christ are contained in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mystery of Transubstantiation</h3>

<p>The next point to be explained is that the substance of the
bread and wine does not continue to exist in the Sacrament after
consecration. This truth, although well calculated to excite our
profound admiration, is yet a necessary consequence from what has
been already established. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Dogma Of The Real Presence</h6>

<p> If, after consecration, the true body of Christ is present
under the species of bread and wine, since it was not there
before, it must have become present either by change of place, or
by creation, or by the change of some other thing into it. It
cannot be rendered present by change of place, because it would
then cease to be in heaven; for whatever is moved must
necessarily cease to occupy the place from which it is moved.
Still less can we suppose the body of Christ to be rendered
present by creation; nay, the very idea is inconceivable. In
order that the body of our Lord be present in the Sacrament, it
remains, therefore, that it be rendered present by the change of
the bread into it. Wherefore it is necessary that none of the
substance of the bread remain.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Councils</h6>

<p> Hence our predecessors in the faith, the Fathers of the
General Councils of Lateran and of Florence, confirmed by solemn
decrees the truth of this dogma. In the Council of Trent it was
still more fully defined in these words: If any one shall say
that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist the substance of
the bread and wine remains, together with the body and blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ, let hint be anathema.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From Scripture</h6>

<p> The doctrine thus defined is a natural inference from the
words of Scripture. When instituting this Sacrament, our Lord
Himself said: This is my body. The word this expresses the entire
substance of the thing present; and therefore if the substance of
the bread remained, our Lord could not have truly said: This is
my body. </p>

<p> In St. John Christ the Lord also says: The bread that I will
give is my flesh, for the life of the world. The bread which He
promises to give, He here declares to be His flesh. A little
after He adds: Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man, and
drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. And again: My
flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. Since,
therefore, in terms so clear and so explicit, He calls His flesh
bread and meat indeed, and His blood drink indeed, He gives us
sufficiently to understand that none of the substance of the
bread and wine remains in the Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Fathers</h6>

<p> Whoever turns over the pages of the holy Fathers will easily
perceive that on this doctrine (of transubstantiation) they have
been at all times unanimous. St. Ambrose says: You say, perhaps,
&quot;this bread is no other than what is used for common
food.&quot; True, before consecration it is bread; but no sooner
are the words of consecration pronounced than from bread it
becomes the flesh of Christ. To prove this position more clearly,
he elucidates it by a variety of comparisons and examples. In
another place, when explaining these words of the Psalmist,
Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done in heaven and on earth,
St. Ambrose says: Although the species of bread and wine are
visible, yet we must believe that after consecration, the body
and blood of Christ are alone there. Explaining the same doctrine
almost in the same words, St. Hilary says that although
externally it appear bread and wine, yet in reality it is the
body and blood of the Lord. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Why The Eucharist Is Called Bread After Consecration </h6>

<p> Here pastors should observe that we should not at all be
surprised, if, even after consecration, the Eucharist is
sometimes called bread. It is so called, first because it retains
the appearance of bread, and secondly because it keeps the
natural quality of bread, which is to support and nourish the
body.</p>

<p> Moreover, such phraseology is in perfect accordance with the
usage of the Holy Scriptures, which call things by what they
appear to be, as may be seen from the words of Genesis which say
that Abraham saw three men, when in reality he saw three Angels.
In like manner the two Angels who appeared to the Apostles after
the Ascension of Christ the Lord into heaven, are called not
Angels, but men.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Meaning of Transubstantiation</h6>

<p> To explain this mystery is extremely difficult. The pastor,
however, should endeavour to instruct those who are more advanced
in the knowledge of divine things on the manner of this admirable
change. As for those who are yet weak in faith, they might
possibly be overwhelmed by its greatness.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Transubstantiation A Total Conversion</h6>

<p> This conversion, then, is so effected that the whole
substance of the bread is changed by the power of God into the
whole substance of the body of Christ, and the whole substance of
the wine into the whole substance of His blood, and this, without
any change in our Lord Himself. He is neither begotten, nor
changed, not increased, but remains entire in His substance.</p>

<p> This sublime mystery St. Ambrose thus declares: You see how
efficacious are the words of Christ. If the word of the Lord
Jesus is so powerful as to summon into existence that which did
not exist, namely the world, how much more powerful is His word
to change into something else that which already has existence ?</p>

<p> Many other ancient and most authoritative Fathers have
written to the same effect. We faithfully confess, says St.
Augustine, that before consecration it is bread and wine, the
product of nature; but after consecration it is the body and
blood of Christ, consecrated by the blessing. The body, says
Damascene, is truly united to the Divinity, that body which was
derived from the virgin; not that the body thus derived descends
from heaven, but that the bread and wine are changed into the
body and blood of Christ. </p>

<p> This admirable change, as the Council of Trent teaches, the
Holy Catholic Church most appropriately expresses by the word
transubstantiation. Since natural changes are rightly called
transformations, because they involve a change of form; so
likewise our predecessors in the faith wisely and appropriately
introduced the term transubstantiation, in order to signify that
in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the whole substance of one
thing passes into the whole substance of another.</p>

<p> According to the admonition so frequently repeated by the
holy Fathers, the faithful are to be admonished against curious
searching into the manner in which this change is effected. It
defies the powers of conception; nor can we find any example of
it in natural transmutations, or even in the very work of
creation. That such a change takes place must be recognised by
faith; how it takes place we must not curiously inquire.</p>

<p> No less of caution should be observed by pastors in
explaining the mysterious manner in which the body of our Lord is
contained whole and entire under the least particle of the bread.
Indeed, discussions of this kind should scarcely ever be entered
upon. Should Christian charity, however, require a departure from
this rule, the pastor should remember first of all to prepare and
fortify his hearers by reminding them that no word shall be
impossible with God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>A Consequence Of Transubstantiation</h6>

<p> The pastor should next teach that our Lord is not in the
Sacrament as in a place. Place regards things only inasmuch as
they have magnitude. Now we do not say that Christ is in the
Sacrament inasmuch as He is great or small, terms which belong to
quantity, but inasmuch as He is a substance. The substance of the
bread is changed into the substance of Christ, not into magnitude
or quantity; and substance, it will be acknowledged by all, is
contained in a small as well as in a large space. The substance
of air, for instance, and its entire nature must be present under
a small as well as a large quantity, and likewise the entire
nature of water must be present no less in a glass than in a
river. Since, then, the body of our Lord succeeds to the
substance of the bread, we must confess it to be in the Sacrament
after the same manner as the substance of the bread was before
consecration; whether the substance of the bread was present in
greater or less quantity is a matter of entire indifference.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Accidents without a Subject </h3>

<p>We now come to the third great and wondrous effect of this
Sacrament, namely, the existence of the species of bread and wine
without a subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Preceding Dogmas</h6>

<p> What has been said in explanation of the two preceding points
must facilitate for pastors the exposition of this truth. For,
since we have already proved that the body and blood of our Lord
are really and truly contained in the Sacrament, to the entire
exclusion of the substance of the bread and wine, and since the
accidents of bread and wine cannot inhere in the body and blood
of Christ, it remains that, contrary to physical laws, they must
subsist of themselves, inhering in no subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Proof From The Teaching Of The Church</h6>

<p> This has been at all times the uniform doctrine of the
Catholic Church; and it can be easily established by the same
authorities which, as we have already proved, make it plain that
the substance of the bread and wine ceases to exist in the
Eucharist. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Advantages Of This Mystery</h6>

<p> Nothing more becomes the piety of the faithful than, omitting
all curious questionings, to revere and adore the majesty of this
august Sacrament, and to recognise the wisdom of God in
commanding that these holy mysteries should be administered under
the species of bread and wine. For since it is most revolting to
human nature to eat human flesh or drink human blood, therefore
God in His infinite wisdom has established the administration of
the body and blood of Christ under the forms of bread and wine,
which are the ordinary and agreeable food of man.</p>

<p> There are two further advantages: first, it prevents the
calumnious reproaches of the unbeliever, from which the eating of
our Lord under His visible form could not easily be defended;
secondly, the receiving Him under a form in which He is
impervious to the senses avails much for increasing our faith.
For faith, as the well known saying of St. Gregory declares, has
no merit in those things which fall under the proof of reason.</p>

<p> The doctrines treated above should be explained with great
caution, according to the capacity of the hearers and the
necessities of the times.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Effects of the Eucharist</h3>

<p>But with regard to the admirable virtue and fruits of this
Sacrament, there is no class of the faithful to whom a knowledge
of them is not most necessary. For all that has been said at such
length on this Sacrament has principally for its object, to make
the faithful sensible of the advantages of the Eucharist. As,
however, no language can convey an adequate idea of its utility
and fruits, pastors must be content to treat of one or two
points, in order to show what an abundance and profusion of all
goods are contained in those sacred mysteries.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Contains Christ And Is The Food Of The
Soul </h3>

<p>This they will in some degree accomplish, if, having explained
the efficacy and nature of all the Sacraments, they compare the
Eucharist to a fountain, the other Sacraments to rivulets. For
the Holy Eucharist is truly and necessarily to be called the
fountain of all graces, containing, as it does, after an
admirable manner, the fountain itself of celestial gifts and
graces, and the author of all the Sacrament, Christ our Lord,
from whom, as from its source, is derived whatever of goodness
and perfection the other Sacraments possess. From this
(comparison), therefore, we may easily infer what most ample
gifts of divine grace are bestowed on us by this Sacrament.</p>

<p> It will also be useful to consider attentively the nature of
bread and wine, which are the symbols of this Sacrament. For what
bread and wine are to the body, the Eucharist is to the health
and delight of the soul, but in a higher and better way. This
Sacrament is not, like bread and wine, changed into our
substance; but we are, in some wise, changed into its nature, so
that we may well apply here the words of St. Augustine: I am the
food of the frown. Grow and thou shalt eat Me; nor shalt thou
change Me into thee, as thy bodily food, but thou shalt be
changed into Me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Gives Grace</h3>

<p>If, then, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, they must
surely be poured into the soul which receives with purity and
holiness Him who said of Himself: He that eateth my flesh and
drinketh my blood abideth in me and I in him. Those who receive
this Sacrament piously and fervently must, beyond all doubt, so
receive the Son of God into their souls as to be ingrafted as
living members on His body. For it is written: He that eateth me,
the same also shall live by me; also: The bread which I will give
is my flesh for the life of the world. Explaining this passage,
St. Cyril says: The Word of God, uniting Himself to His own
flesh, imparted to it a vivifying power: it became Him,
therefore, to unite Himself to our bodies in a wonderful manner,
through His sacred flesh and precious blood, which we receive in
the bread and wine, consecrated by His vivifying benediction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Grace Of The Eucharist Sustains</h3>

<p>When it is said that the Eucharist imparts grace, pastors must
admonish that this does not mean that the state of grace is not
required for a profitable reception of this Sacrament. For as
natural food can be of no use to the dead, so in like manner the
sacred mysteries can evidently be of no avail to a soul which
lives not by the spirit. Hence this Sacrament has been instituted
under the forms of bread and wine to signify that the object of
its institution is not to recall the soul to life, but to
preserve its life.</p>

<p> The reason, then, for saying that this Sacrament imparts
grace, is that even the first grace, with which all should be
clothed before they presume to approach the Holy Eucharist, lest
they eat and drink judgment to themselves,' is given to none
unless they receive in wish and desire this very Sacrament. For
the Eucharist is the end of all the Sacraments, and the symbol of
unity and brotherhood in the Church, outside which none can
attain grace. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Grace Of The Eucharist Invigorates And Delights </h3>

<p>Again, just as the body is not only supported but also
increased by natural food, from which the taste every day derives
new relish and pleasure; so also is the soul not only sustained
but invigorated by feasting on the food of the Eucharist, which
gives to the spirit an increasing zest for heavenly things. Most
truly and fitly therefore do we say that grace is imparted by
this Sacrament, for it may be justly compared to the manna having
in it the sweetness of every taste.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Remits Venial Sins</h3>

<p>It cannot be doubted that by the Eucharist are remitted and
pardoned lighter sins, commonly called venial. Whatever the soul
has lost through the fire of passion, by falling into some slight
offence, all this the Eucharist, cancelling those lesser faults,
repairs, in the same way ­­ not to depart from the illustration
already adduced ­­ as natural food gradually restores and
repairs the daily waste caused by the force of the vital heat
within us. Justly, therefore, has St. Ambrose said of this
heavenly Sacrament: That daily bread is taken as a remedy for
daily infirmity. But these things are to be understood of those
sins for which no actual affection is retained.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Strengthens Against Temptation </h3>

<p>There is, furthermore, such a power in the sacred mysteries as
to preserve us pure and unsullied from sin, keep us safe from the
assaults of temptation, and, as by some heavenly medicine,
prepare the soul against the easy approach and infection of
virulent and deadly disease. Hence, as St. Cyprian records, when
the faithful were formerly hurried in multitudes by tyrants to
torments and death, because they confessed the name of Christ, it
was an ancient usage in the Catholic Church to give them, by the
hands of the Bishop, the Sacrament of the body and blood of our
Lord, lest perhaps overcome by the severity of their sufferings,
they should fail in the fight for salvation.</p>

<p> It also restrains and represses the lusts of the flesh, for
while it inflames the soul more ardently with the fire of
charity, it of necessity extinguishes the ardour of
concupiscence. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist Facilitates The Attainment Of Eternal
Life</h3>

<p>Finally, to comprise all the advantages and blessings of this
Sacrament in one word, it must be taught that the Holy Eucharist
is most efficacious towards the attainment of eternal glory. For
it is written: He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,
hath everlasting life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
That is to say, by the grace of this Sacrament men enjoy the
greatest peace and tranquillity of conscience during the present
life; and, when the hour of departing from this world shall have
arrived, like Elias, who in the strength of the bread baked on
the hearth, walked to Horeb, the mount of God, they, too,
invigorated by the strengthening influence of this (heavenly
food), will ascend to unfading glory and bliss.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How The Effects Of The Eucharist May Be Developed And
Illustrated </h3>

<p>All these matters will be most fully expounded by pastors, if
they but dwell or. the sixth chapter of St. John, in which are
developed the manifold effects of this Sacrament. Or again,
glancing at the admirable actions of Christ our Lord, they may
show that if those who received Him beneath their roof during His
mortal life, or were restored to health by touching His vesture
or the hem of His garment, were justly and deservedly deemed most
blessed, how much more fortunate and happy we, into whose soul,
resplendent as He is with unfading glory, He disdains not to
enter, to heal all its wounds, to adorn it with His choicest
gifts, and unite it to Himself.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Recipient of the Eucharist</h3>

<h3>Threefold Manner Of Communicating</h3>

<p>That the faithful may learn to be zealous for the better
gifts, they must be shown who can obtain these abundant fruits
from the Holy Eucharist, must be reminded that there is not only
one way of communicating. Wisely and rightly, then, did our
predecessors in the faith, as we read in the Council of Trent,
distinguish three ways of receiving this Sacrament.</p>

<p> Some receive it sacramentally only. Such are those sinners
who do not fear to approach the holy mysteries with polluted lips
and heart, who, as the Apostle says, eat and drink the Lord's
body unworthily. Of this class of communicants St. Augustine
says: He who dwells not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells not,
most certainly does not eat spiritually His flesh, although
carnally and visibly he press with his teeth the Sacrament of His
flesh and blood. Those, therefore, who receive the sacred
mysteries with such a disposition, not only obtain no fruit
therefrom, but, as the Apostle himself testifies, eat and drink
judgment to themselves. </p>

<p> Others are said to receive the Eucharist in spirit only. They
are those who, inflamed with a lively faith which worketh by
charity,' partake in wish and desire of that celestial bread
offered to them, from which they receive, if not the entire, at
least very great fruits.</p>

<p> Lastly, there are some who receive the Holy Eucharist both
sacramentally and spiritually, those who, according to the
teaching of the Apostle, having first proved themselves and
having approached this divine banquet adorned with the nuptial
garment, derive from the Eucharist those most abundant fruits
which we have already described. Hence it is clear that those
who, having it in their power to receive with fitting preparation
the Sacrament of the body of the Lord, are yet satisfied with a
spiritual Communion only, deprive themselves of the greatest and
most heavenly advantages. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of Previous Preparation For Communion </h3>

<p>We now come to point out the manner in which the faithful
should be previously prepared for sacramental Communion. To
demonstrate the great necessity of this previous preparation, the
example of the Saviour should be adduced. Before He gave to His
Apostles the Sacrament of His precious body and blood, although
they were already clean, He washed their feet to show that we
must use extreme diligence before Holy Communion in order to
approach it with the greatest purity and innocence of soul.</p>

<p> In the next place, the faithful are to understand that as he
who approaches thus prepared and disposed is adorned with the
most ample gifts of heavenly grace; so, on the contrary, he who
approaches without this preparation not only derives from it no
advantage, but even incurs the greatest misfortune and loss. It
is characteristic of the best and most salutary things that, if
seasonably made use of, they are productive of the greatest
benefit; but if employed out of time, they prove most pernicious
and destructive. It cannot, therefore, excite out surprise that
the great and exalted gifts of God; when received into a soul
properly disposed, are of the greatest assistance towards the
attainment of salvation; while to those who receive them
unworthily, they bring with them eternal death.</p>

<p> Of this the Ark of the Lord affords a convincing
illustration. The people of Israel possessed nothing more
precious and it was to them the source of innumerable blessings
from God; but when the Philistines carried it away, it brought on
them a most destructive plague and the heaviest calamities,
together with eternal disgrace. Thus also food when received from
the mouth into a healthy stomach nourishes and supports the body;
but when received into an indisposed stomach, causes grave
disorders.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Preparation Of Soul</h3>

<p>The first preparation, then, which the faithful should make,
is to distinguish table from table, this sacred table from
profane tables, this celestial bread from common bread. This we
do when we firmly believe that there is truly present the body
and blood of the Lord, of Him whom the Angels adore in heaven, at
whose nod the pillars of heaven fear and tremble, of whose glory
the heavens and the earth are full. This is to discern the body
of the Lord in accordance with the admonition of the Apostle. We
should venerate the greatness of the mystery rather than too
curiously investigate its truth by idle inquiry.</p>

<p> Another very necessary preparation is to ask ourselves if we
are at peace with and sincerely love our neigh r. If, therefore,
thou offerest thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath anything against thee, leave there thy offering
before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother,
and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.</p>

<p> We should, in the next place, carefully examine whether our
consciences be defiled by mortal sin, which has to be repented
of, in order that it may be blotted out before Communion by the
remedy of contrition and confession. The Council of Trent has
defined that no one conscious of mortal sin and having an
opportunity of going to confession, however contrite he may deem
himself, is to approach the Holy Eucharist until he has been
purified by sacramental confession. </p>

<p> We should also reflect in the silence of our own hearts how
unworthy we are that the Lord should bestow on us this divine
gift, and with the centurion of whom our Lord declared that he
found not so great faith in Israel, we should exclaim from our
hearts: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my
roof.</p>

<p> We should also put the question to ourselves whether we can
truly say with Peter: Lord, thou knowest that I love thee, and
should recollect that he who sat down at the banquet of the Lord
without a wedding garment was cast into a dark dungeon and
condemned to eternal torments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Preparation Of Body</h3>

<p>Our preparation should not, however, be confined to the soul;
it should also extend to the body. We are to approach the Holy
Table fasting, having neither eaten nor drunk anything at least
from the preceding midnight until the moment of Communion. </p>

<p> The dignity of so great a Sacrament also demands that married
persons abstain from the marriage debt for some days previous to
Communion. This observance is recommended by the example of
David, who, when about to receive the show­bread from the hands
of the priest, declared that he and his servants had been clean
from women for three days.</p>

<p> The above are the principal things to be done by the faithful
preparatory to receiving the sacred mysteries with profit; and to
these heads may be reduced whatever other things may seem
desirable by way of preparation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Obligation of Communion</h3>

<h3>How Often Must Communion Be Received?</h3>

<p>Lest any be kept away from Communion by the fear that the
requisite preparation is too hard and laborious, the faithful are
frequently to be reminded that they are all bound to receive the
Holy Eucharist. Furthermore, the Church has decreed that whoever
neglects to approach Holy Communion once a year, at Easter, is
liable to sentence of excommunication.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Church Desires The Faithful To Communicate Daily</h3>

<p>However, let not the faithful imagine that it is enough to
receive the body of the Lord once a year only, in obedience to
the decree of the Church. They should approach oftener; but
whether monthly, weekly, or daily, cannot be decided by any fixed
universal rule. St. Augustine, however, lays down a most certain
norm: Live in such a manner as to be able to receive every day. </p>

<p> It will therefore be the duty of the pastor frequently to
admonish the faithful that, as they deem it necessary to afford
daily nutriment to the body, they should also feel solicitous to
feed and nourish the soul every day with this heavenly food. It
is clear that the soul stands not less in need of spiritual, than
the body of corporal food. Here it will be found most useful to
recall the inestimable and divine advantages which, as we have
already shown, flow from sacramental Communion. It will be well
also to refer to the manna, which was a figure (of this
Sacrament), and which refreshed the bodily powers every day. The
Fathers who earnestly recommended the frequent reception of this
Sacrament may also be cited. The words of St. Augustine, Thou
sinnest daily, receive daily, express not his opinion only, but
that of all the Fathers who have written on the subject, as
anyone may easily discover who will carefully read them.</p>

<p> That there was a time when the faithful approached Holy
Communion every day we learn from the Acts of the Apostles. All
who then professed the faith of Christ burned with such true and
sincere charity that, devoting themselves to prayer and other
works of piety, they were found prepared to communicate daily.
This devout practice, which seems to have been interrupted for a
time, was again partially revived by the holy Pope and martyr
Anacletus, who commanded that all the ministers who assisted at
the Sacrifice of the Mass should communicate­an ordinance, as
the Pontiff declares, of Apostolic institution. It was also for a
long time the practice of the Church that, as soon as the
Sacrifice was complete, and when the priest himself had
communicated, he turned to the congregation and invited the
faithful to the Holy Table in these words: Come, brethren, and
receive Communion; and thereupon those who were prepared,
advanced to receive the holy mysteries with the most fervent
devotion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Church Commands; The Faithful To Communicate Once
A Year </h3>

<p>But subsequently, when charity and devotion had grown so cold
that the faithful very seldom approached Communion, it was
decreed by Pope Fabian, that all should communicate thrice every
year, at Christmas, at Easter and at Pentecost. This decree was
afterwards confirmed by many Councils, particularly by the first
of Agde. </p>

<p> Such at length was the decay of piety that not only was this
holy and salutary law unobserved, but Communion was deferred for
years. The Council of Lateran, therefore, decreed that all the
faithful should receive the sacred body of the Lord, at least
once a year, at Easter, and that neglect of this duty should be
chastised by exclusion from the society of the faithful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Who Are Obliged By The Law Of Communion</h3>

<p>But although this law, sanctioned by the authority of God and
of His Church, concerns all the faithful, it should be taught
that it does not extend to those who on account of their tender
age have not attained the use of reason. For these are not able
to distinguish the Holy Eucharist from common and ordinary bread
and cannot bring with them to this Sacrament piety and devotion.
Furthermore (to extend the precept to them) would appear
inconsistent with the ordinance of our Lord, for He said: Take
and eat words which cannot apply to infants, who are evidently
incapable of taking and eating.</p>

<p> In some places, it is true, an ancient practice prevailed of
giving the Holy Eucharist even to infants; but, for the reasons
already assigned, and for other reasons in keeping with Christian
piety, this practice has been long discontinued by authority of
the Church. </p>

<p> With regard to the age at which children should be given the
holy mysteries, this the parents and confessor can best
determine. To them it belongs to inquire and to ascertain from
the children themselves whether they have some knowledge of this
admirable Sacrament and whether they desire to receive it.</p>

<p> Communion must not be given to persons who are insane and
incapable of devotion. However, according to the decree of the
Council of Carthage, it may be administered to them at the close
of life, provided they have shown, before losing their minds, a
pious and religious disposition, and no danger, arising from the
state of the stomach or other inconvenience or disrespect, is
likely.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Rite of Administering Communion</h3>

<p>As to the rite to be observed in communicating, pastors should
teach that the law of the holy Church forbids Communion under
both kinds to anyone but the officiating priests, without the
authority of the Church itself.</p>

<p> Christ the Lord, it is true, as has been explained by the
Council of Trent, instituted and delivered to His Apostles at His
Last Supper this most sublime Sacrament under the species of
bread and wine; but it does not follow that by doing so our Lord
and Saviour established a law ordering its administration to all
the faithful under both species. For speaking of this Sacrament,
He Himself frequently mentions it under one kind only, as, for
instance, when He says: If any man eat of this bread, he shall
live for ever, and: The bread that I will give is my flesh for
the life of the world, and: He that eateth this bread shall live
for ever. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why The Celebrant Alone Receives Under Both Species </h3>

<p>It is clear that the Church was influenced by numerous and
most cogent reasons, not only to approve, but also to confirm by
authority of its decree, the general practice of communicating
under one species. In the first place, the greatest caution was
necessary to avoid spilling the blood of the Lord on the ground,
a thing that seemed not easily to be avoided, if the chalice were
administered in a large assemblage of the people.</p>

<p> In the next place, whereas the Holy Eucharist ought to be in
readiness for the sick, it was very much to be apprehended, were
the species of wine to remain long unconsumed, that it might turn
acid.</p>

<p> Besides, there are many who cannot at all bear the taste or
even the smell of wine. Lest, therefore, what is intended for the
spiritual health should prove hurtful to the health of the body,
it has been most prudently provided by the Church that it should
be administered to the people under the species of bread only.</p>

<p> We may also further observe that in many countries wine is
extremely scarce; nor can it, moreover, be brought from elsewhere
without incurring very heavy expenses and encountering very
tedious and difficult journeys.</p>

<p> Finally, a most important reason was the necessity of
opposing the heresy of those who denied that Christ, whole and
entire, is contained under either species, and asserted that the
body is contained under the species of bread without the blood,
and the blood under the species of wine without the body. In
order, therefore, to place more clearly before the eyes of all
the truth of the Catholic faith, Communion under one kind, that
is, under the species of bread, was most wisely introduced.</p>

<p> There are also other reasons, collected by those who have
treated on this subject, and which, if it shall appear necessary,
can be brought forward by pastors.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Minister of the Eucharist</h3>

<p>To omit nothing doctrinal on this Sacrament, we now come to
speak of its minister, a point, however. on which scarcely anyone
can be ignorant.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Only Priests Have Power To Consecrate And Administer
The Eucharist </h3>

<p>It must be taught, then, that to priests alone has been given
power to consecrate and administer to the faithful, the Holy
Eucharist. That this has been the unvarying practice of the
Church, that the faithful should receive the Sacrament from the
priests, and that the officiating priests should communicate
themselves, has been explained by the holy Council of Trent,
which has also shown that this practice, as having proceeded from
Apostolic tradition, is to be religiously retained, particularly
as Christ the Lord has left us an illustrious example thereof,
having consecrated His own most sacred body, and given it to the
Apostles with His own hands.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Laity Prohibited To Touch The Sacred Vessels </h3>

<p>To safeguard in every possible way the dignity of so august a
Sacrament, not only is the power of its administration entrusted
exclusively to priests, but the Church has also prohibited by law
any but consecrated persons, unless some case of great necessity
intervene, to dare handle or touch the sacred vessels, the linen,
or other instruments necessary to its completion.</p>

<p> Priests themselves and the rest of the faithful may hence
understand how great should be the piety and holiness of those
who approach to consecrate, administer or receive the Eucharist. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Unworthiness Of The Minister Does Not Invalidate
The Sacrament </h3>

<p>What, however, has been already said of the other Sacraments,
holds good also with regard to the Sacrament of the Eucharist;
namely, that a Sacrament is validly administered even by the
wicked, provided all the essentials have been duly observed. For
we are to believe that all these depend not on the merit of the
minister, but are operated by the virtue and power of Christ our
Lord.</p>

<p> These are the things necessary to be explained regarding the
Eucharist as a Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Eucharist as a Sacrifice</h3>

<p>We must now proceed to explain its nature as a Sacrifice, that
pastors may understand what are the principal instructions which
they ought to impart to the faithful on Sundays and holy days,
regarding this mystery in conformity with the decree of the holy
Council (of Trent).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On The Mass</h3>

<p>This Sacrament is not only a treasure of heavenly riches,
which if turned to good account will obtain for us the grace and
love of God; but it also possesses a peculiar character, by which
we are enabled to make some return to God for the immense
benefits bestowed upon us.</p>

<p> How grateful and acceptable to God is this victim, if duly
and legitimately immolated, is inferred from the following
consideration. Of the sacrifices of the Old Law it is written:
Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldst not; and again: If thou hadst
desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with
burnt­offerings thou wilt not be delighted. Now if these were so
pleasing in the Lord's sight that, as the Scripture testifies,
from them God smelled a sweet savour, that is to say, they were
grateful and acceptable to Him; what have we not to hope from
that Sacrifice in which is immolated and offered He Himself of
whom a voice from heaven twice proclaimed: This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased. </p>

<p> This mystery, therefore, pastors should carefully explain, so
that when the faithful are assembled at the celebration of divine
service, they may learn to meditate with attention and devotion
on the sacred things at which they are present.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Distinction of Sacrament and Sacrifice</h3>

<p>They should teach, then, in the first place, that the
Eucharist was instituted by Christ for two purposes: one, that it
might be the heavenly food of our souls, enabling us to support
and preserve spiritual life; and the other, that the Church might
have a perpetual Sacrifice, by which our sins might be expiated,
and our heavenly Father, oftentimes grievously offended by our
crimes, might be turned away from wrath to mercy, from the
severity of just chastisement to clemency. Of this thing we may
observe a type and resemblance in the Paschal lamb, which was
wont to be offered and eaten by the children of Israel as a
sacrament and a sacrifice.</p>

<p> Nor could our Saviour, when about to offer Himself to God the
Father on the altar of the cross, have given any more illustrious
indication of His unbounded love towards us than by bequeathing
to us a visible Sacrifice, by which that bloody Sacrifice, which
was soon after to be offered once on the cross, would be renewed,
and its memory daily celebrated with the greatest utility, unto
the consummation of ages by the Church diffused throughout the
world.</p>

<p> But (between the Eucharist as a Sacrament and a Sacrifice)
the difference is very great; for as a Sacrament it is perfected
by consecration; as a Sacrifice, all its force consists in its
oblation. When, therefore, kept in a pyx, or borne to the sick,
it is a Sacrament, not a Sacrifice. As a Sacrament also, it is to
them that receive it a source of merit, and brings with it all
those advantages which have been already mentioned; but as a
Sacrifice, it is not only a source of merit, but also of
satisfaction. For as, in His Passion, Christ the Lord merited and
satisfied for us; so also those who offer this Sacrifice, by
which they communicate with us, merit the fruit of His Passion,
and satisfy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mass Is a True Sacrifice</h3>

<h3>Proof From The Council Of Trent</h3>

<p>With regard to the institution of this Sacrifice, the holy
Council of Trent has left no room for doubt, by declaring that it
was instituted by our Lord at His Last Supper; while it condemns
under anathema all those who assert that in it is not offered to
God a true and proper Sacrifice; or that to offer means nothing
else than that Christ is given as our spiritual food. </p>

<p> Nor did (the Council) omit carefully to explain that to God
alone is offered this Sacrifice. For although the Church
sometimes offers Masses in honour and in memory of the Saints,
yet she teaches that the Sacrifice is offered, not to them, but
to God alone, who has crowned the Saints with immortal glory.
Hence the priest never says: I offer Sacrifice to thee Peter, or
to thee Paul; but, while he offers Sacrifice to God alone, he
renders Him thanks for the signal victory won by the blessed
martyrs, and thus implores their patronage, that they, whose
memory we celebrate on earth, may vouchsafe to intercede for us
in heaven.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Proof From Scripture</h3>

<p>This doctrine, handed down by the Catholic Church, concerning
the truth of this Sacrifice, she received from the words of our
Lord, when, on that last night, committing to His Apostles these
same sacred mysteries, He said: Do this for a commemoration of
me; for then, as was defined by the holy Council, He ordained
them priests, and commanded that they and their successors in the
priestly office, should immolate and offer His body.</p>

<p> Of this the words of the Apostle to the Corinthians also
afford a sufficient proof: You cannot drink the chalice of the
Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the
table of the Lord and of the? table of devils. As then by the
table of devils must be understood the altar on which sacrifice
was offered to them; so also ­ if the conclusion proposed to
himself by the Apostle is to be legitimately drawn ­­ by the
table of the Lord can be understood nothing else than the altar
on which Sacrifice was offered to the Lord.</p>

<p> Should we look for figures and prophecies of this Sacrifice
in the Old Testament, in the first place Malachy most clearly
prophesied thereof in these words: From the rising of the sun
even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and
in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my
name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles,
saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p> Moreover, this victim was foretold, as well before as after
the promulgation of the Law, by various kinds of sacrifices; for
this victim alone, as the perfection and completion of all,
comprises all the blessings which were signified by the other
sacrifices. In nothing, however, do we behold a more lively image
of the Eucharistic Sacrifice than in that of Melchisedech; for
the Saviour Himself offered to God the Father, at His Last
Supper, His body and blood, under the appearances of bread and
wine, declaring that He was constituted a priest for ever, after
the order of Melchisedech. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Excellence of the Mass</h3>

<h3>The Mass Is The Same Sacrifice As That Of The Cross</h3>

<p>We therefore confess that the Sacrifice of the Mass is and
ought to be considered one and the same Sacrifice as that of the
cross, for the victim is one and the same, namely, Christ our
Lord, who offered Himself, once only, a bloody Sacrifice on the
altar of the cross. The bloody and unbloody victim are not two,
but one victim only, whose Sacrifice is daily renewed in the
Eucharist, in obedience to the command of our Lord: Do this for a
commemoration of me.</p>

<p> The priest is also one and the same, Christ the Lord; for the
ministers who offer Sacrifice, consecrate the holy mysteries, not
in their own person, but in that of Christ, as the words of
consecration itself show, for the priest does not say: This is
the body of Christ, but, This is my body; and thus, acting in the
Person of Christ the Lord, he changes the substance of the bread
and wine into the true substance of His body and blood. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mass A Sacrifice Of Praise, Thanksgiving And
Propitiation </h3>

<p>This being the case, it must be taught without any hesitation
that, as the holy Council (of Trent) has also) explained, the
sacred and holy Sacrifice of the Mass is not a Sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving only, or a mere commemoration of the
Sacrifice performed on the cross, but also truly a propitiatory
Sacrifice, by which God is appeased and rendered propitious to
us. If, therefore, with a pure heart, a lively faith, and
affected with an inward sorrow for our transgressions, we
immolate and offer this most holy victim, we shall, without
doubt, obtain mercy from the Lord, and grace in time of need; for
SO delighted is the Lord with the door of this victim that,
bestowing on us the gift of grace and repentance, He pardons our
sins. Hence this usual prayer of the Church: As often as the
commemoration of this victim is celebrated, so often is the work
of our salvation being done; that is to say, through this
unbloody Sacrifice flow to us the most plenteous fruits of that
bloody victim.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Mass Profits Both The Living And The Dead </h3>

<p>Pastors should next teach that such is the efficacy of this
Sacrifice that its benefits extend not only to the celebrant and
communicant, but to all the faithful, whether living with us on
earth, or already numbered with those who are dead in the Lord,
but whose sins have not yet been fully expiated. For, according
to the most authentic Apostolic tradition, it is not less
available when offered for them, than when offered for the sins
of the living, their punishments, satisfactions, calamities and
difficulties of every sort.</p>

<p> It is hence easy to perceive, that all Masses, as being
conducive to the common interest and salvation of all the
faithful, are to be considered common to all.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Rites and ceremonies of the Mass</h3>

<p>The Sacrifice (of the Mass) is celebrated with many solemn
rites and ceremonies, none of which should be deemed useless or
superfluous. On the contrary, all of them tend to display the
majesty of this august Sacrifice, and to excite the faithful when
beholding these saving mysteries, to contemplate the divine
things which lie concealed in the Eucharistic Sacrifice. On these
rites and ceremonies we shall not dwell, since they require a
more lengthy exposition than is compatible with the nature of the
present work; moreover priests can easily consult on the subject
some of the many booklets and works that have been written by
pious and learned men.</p>

<p> What has been said so far will, with the divine assistance,
be found sufficient to explain the principal things which regard
the Holy Eucharist both as a Sacrament and Sacrifice.</p>
