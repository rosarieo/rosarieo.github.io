<h3>THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT : &quot;<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>&quot;
</h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment </h3>

<p>The great happiness proposed to the peacemakers, of being
called the children of God, should prove a powerful incentive to
the pastor to explain to the faithful with care and accuracy the
obligations imposed by this Commandment. No means more
efficacious can be adopted to promote peace among mankind, than
the proper explanation of this Commandment and its holy and due
observance by all. Then might we hope that men, united in the
strictest bonds of union, would live in perfect peace and
concord.</p>

<p> The necessity of explaining this Commandment is proved from
the following. Immediately after the earth was overwhelmed in
universal deluge, this was the first prohibition made by God to
man. I will require the blood of your lives, He said, at the hand
of every beast and at the hand of man. In the next place, among
the precepts of the Old Law expounded by our Lord, this
Commandment was mentioned first by Him; concerning which it is
written in the Gospel of St. Matthew: It has been said thou shalt
not kill, etc.</p>

<p> The faithful, on their part, should hear with willing
attention the explanation of this Commandment, since its purpose
is to protect the life of each one. These words, Thou shalt not
kill, emphatically forbid homicide; and they should be heard by
all with the same pleasure as if God, expressly naming each
individual, were to prohibit injury to be offered him under a
threat of the divine anger and the heaviest chastisements. As,
then, the announcement of this Commandment must be heard with
pleasure, so also should the avoidance of the sin which it
forbids give pleasure.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Two Parts Of This Commandment</h3>

<p>In the explanation of this Commandment the Lord points out its
twofold obligation. The one is prohibitory and forbids us to
kill; the other is mandatory and commands us to cherish
sentiments of charity, concord and friendship towards our
enemies, to have peace with all men, and finally, to endure with
patience every inconvenience. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Prohibitory Part of this Commandment</h3>

<h3>Exceptions: The Killing Of Animals</h3>

<p>With regard to the prohibitory part, it should first be taught
what kinds of killing are not forbidden by this Commandment. It
is not prohibited to kill animals; for if God permits man to eat
them, it is also lawful to kill them. When, says St. Augustine,
we hear the words, &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; we do not
understand this of the fruits of the earth, which are insensible,
nor of irrational animals, which form no part of human society. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Execution Of Criminals</h3>

<p>Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil
authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the
legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and
protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from
involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience
to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the
Commandment足 is the preservation and security of human life. Now
the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the
legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since
they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence.
Hence these words of David: In the morning I put to death all the
wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of
iniquity from the city of the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Killing In A Just War</h3>

<p>In like manner, the soldier is guiltless who, actuated not by
motives of ambition or cruelty, but by a pure desire of serving
the interests of his country, takes away the life of an enemy in
a just war.</p>

<p> Furthermore, there are on record instances of carnage
executed by the special command of God. The sons of Levi, who put
to death so many thousands in one day, were guilty of no sin;
when the slaughter had ceased, they were addressed by Moses in
these words: You have consecrated your hands this day to the
Lord. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Killing By Accident</h3>

<p>Again, death caused, not by intent or design, but by accident,
is not murder. He that killeth his neighbour ignorantly, says the
book of Deuteronomy, and who is proved to have had no hatred
against him yesterday and the day before, but to have gone with
him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe
slipt out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle
struck his friend and killed him, shall live. Such accidental
deaths, because inflicted without intent or design, involve no
guilt whatever, and this is confirmed by the words of St.
Augustine: God forbid that what we do for a good and lawful end
shall be imputed to us, if, contrary to our intention, evil
thereby befall any one.</p>

<p> There are, however, two cases in which guilt attaches (to
accidental death). The first case is when death results from an
unlawful act; when, for instance, a person kicks or strikes a
woman in a state of pregnancy, and abortion follows. The
consequence, it is true, may not have been intended, but this
does not exculpate the offender, because the act of striking a
pregnant woman is in itself unlawful. The other case is when
death is caused by negligence, carelessness or want of due
precaution.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Killing In Self足Defence</h3>

<p>If a man kill another in self足defence, having used every
means consistent with his own safety to avoid the infliction of
death, he evidently does not violate this Commandment.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Negative Part Of This Commandment Forbids Murder And
Suicide </h3>

<p>The above are the cases in which life may be taken without
violating this Commandment; and with these exceptions all other
killing is forbidden, whether we consider the person who kills,
the person killed, or the means used to kill.</p>

<p> As to the person who kills, the Commandment recognises no
exception whatever, be he rich or powerful, master or足parent.
All, without exception or distinction, are forbidden to kill. </p>

<p> With regard to the person killed, the law extends to all.
There is no individual, however humble or lowly his condition,
whose life is not shielded by this law.</p>

<p> It also forbids suicide. No man possesses such power over his
own life as to be at liberty to put himself to death. Hence we
find that the Commandment does not say: Thou shalt not kill
another, but simply: Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p> Finally, if we consider the numerous means by which murder
may be committed, the law admits of no exception. Not only does
it forbid to take away the life of another by laying violent
hands on him, by means of a sword, a stone, a stick, a halter, or
by administering poison; but also strictly prohibits the
accomplishment of the death of another by counsel, assistance,
help or any other means whatever.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sinful Anger Is Also Forbidden By The Fifth
Commandment </h3>

<p>The Jews, with singular dullness of apprehension, thought that
to abstain from taking life with their own hands was enough to
satisfy the obligation imposed by this Commandment. But the
Christian, instructed in the interpretation of Christ, has
learned that the precept is spiritual, and that it commands us
not only to keep our hands unstained, but our hearts pure and
undefiled; hence what the Jews regarded as quite sufficient, is
not sufficient at all. For the Gospel has taught that it is
unlawful even to be angry with anyone: But I say to you that
whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the
judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother,
&quot;Raca,&quot; shall be in danger of the council. And
whosoever shall say, &quot;Thou fool,&quot; shall be in danger of
hell fire. From these words it clearly follows that he who is
angry with his brother is not free from sin, even though he
conceals his resentment; that he who gives indication of his
wrath sins grievously; and that he who does not hesitate to treat
another with harshness, and to utter contumelious reproaches
against him, sins still more grievously. </p>

<p> This, however, is to be understood of cases in which no just
cause of anger exists. God and His laws permit us to be angry
when we chastise the faults of those who are subject to us. For
the anger of a Christian should spring from the Holy Spirit and
not from carnal impulse, seeing that we should be temples of the
Holy Ghost, in which Jesus Christ may dwell.</p>

<p> Our Lord has left us many other lessons of instruction with
regard to the perfect observance of this law, such as Not to
resist evil; but if one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to
him also the other. And if a man will contend with thee in
judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him;
and whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him two.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Remedies Against The Violation Of This Commandment </h3>

<p>From what has been said, it is easy to see how inclined man is
to those sins which are prohibited by this Commandment, and how
many are guilty of murder, if not in fact, at least in desire.
As, then, the Sacred Scriptures prescribe remedies for so
dangerous a disease, the pastor should spare no pains in making
them known to the faithful.</p>

<p> Of these remedies the most efficacious is to form a just
conception of the wickedness of murder. The enormity of this sin
is manifest from many and weighty passages of Holy Scripture. So
much does God abominate homicide that He declares in Holy Writ
that of the very beast of the field He will exact vengeance for
the life of man, commanding the beast that injures man to be put
to death. And if (the Almighty) commanded man to have a horror of
blood,' He did so for no other reason than to impress on his mind
the obligation of entirely refraining, both in act and desire,
from the enormity of homicide.</p>

<p> The murderer is the worst enemy of his species, and
consequently of nature. To the utmost of his power he destroys
the universal work of God by the destruction of man, since God
declares that He created all things for man's sake. Nay, as it is
forbidden in Genesis to take human life, because God created man
to his own image and likeness, he who makes away with God's image
offers great injury to God, and almost seems to lay violent hands
on God Himself !</p>

<p> David, thinking of this with a mind divinely illumined,
complained bitterly of the bloodthirsty in these words: Their
feet are swift to shed blood. He does not simply say, they kill,
but, they shed blood, words which serve to mark the enormity of
that execrable crime and to denote the barbarous cruelty of the
murderer. With a view also to describe in particular how the
murderer is precipitated by the impulse of the devil into the
commission of such a crime, he says: Their feet are swift.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Positive Part of this commandment</h3>

<h3>Love Of Neighbour Inculcated</h3>

<p>The mandatory part of this Commandment, as Christ our Lord
enjoins, requires that we have peace with all men. Interpreting
the Commandment He says: If therefore thou offer thy gift at the
altar, and there thou remember that thy brother hath anything
against thee; leave there thy offering before the altar, and go
first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt
offer thy gift, etc. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Charity To All Commanded</h3>

<p>In explaining this admonition, the pastor should show that it
inculcates the duty of charity towards all without exception. In
his instruction on the precept he should exhort the faithful as
much as possible to the practice of this virtue, since it is
especially included in this precept. For since hatred is clearly
forbidden by this Commandment, as whosoever hateth his brother is
a murderer, it follows, as an evident consequence, that the
Commandment also inculcates charity and love.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Patience, Beneficence And Mildness Commanded </h3>

<p>And since the Commandment inculcates charity and love, it must
also enjoin all those duties and good offices which follow in
their train. Charity is patient, says St. Paul. We are therefore
commanded patience, in which, as the Redeemer teaches, we shall
possess our souls. Charity is kind; beneficence is, therefore,
the friend and companion of charity. The virtue of beneficence
and kindness has a great range. Its principal offices are to
relieve the wants of the poor, to feed the hungry, to give drink
to the thirsty, to clothe the naked; and in all these acts of
beneficence we should proportion our liberality to the wants and
necessities of those we help.</p>

<p> These works of beneficence and goodness, in themselves
exalted, become still more illustrious when done towards an
enemy; for our Saviour says: Love your enemies, do good to them
that hate you, which also the Apostle enjoins in these words: If
thine enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give hint
to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
head. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.</p>

<p> Finally, if we consider the law of charity, which is kind, we
shall be convinced that to practice the good offices of mildness,
clemency, and other kindred virtues, is a duty prescribed by that
law.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Forgiveness Of Injuries Commanded</h3>

<p>But the most important duty of all, and that which is the
fullest expression of charity, and to the practice of which we
should most habituate ourselves, is to pardon and forgive from
the heart the injuries which we may have received from others.
The Sacred Scriptures, as we have already observed, frequently
admonish and exhort us to a full compliance with this duty. Not
only do they pronounce blessed those who do this, but they also
declare that God grants pardon to those who really fulfil this
duty, while He refuses pardon to those who neglect it, or refuse
to obey it. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How to Persuade Men to Forgive Injuries</h3>

<p>As the desire of revenge is almost natural to man, it becomes
necessary for the pastor to exert his utmost diligence not only
to instruct, but also earnestly to persuade the faithful, that a
Christian should forgive and forget injuries; and as this is a
duty frequently inculcated by sacred writers, he should consult
them on the subject, in order to be able to subdue the
pertinacity of those whose minds are obstinately bent on revenge,
and he should have ready the forcible and appropriate arguments
which those Fathers piously employed. The three following
considerations, however, demand particular exposition.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>All We Have To Endure Comes From God</h3>

<p>First, he who thinks himself injured ought above all to be
persuaded that the man on whom he desires to be revenged was not
the principal cause of the loss or injury. Thus that admirable
man, Job, when violently injured by the Sabeans, the Chaldeans,
and by Satan, took no account of these, but as a righteous and
very holy man exclaimed with no less truth than piety: The Lord
gave, the Lord hath taken away. The words and the example of that
man of patience should, therefore, convince Christians, and the
conviction is most just, that whatever chastisements we endure in
this life come from the hand of God, the Father and Author of all
justice and mercy. He chastises us not as enemies, but, in His
infinite goodness, corrects us as children. To view the matter in
its true light, men, in these cases, are nothing more than the
ministers and agents of God. One man, it is true, may cherish the
worst feelings towards another, he may harbour the most malignant
hatred against him; but, without the permission of God, he can do
him no injury. This is why Joseph was able patiently to endure
the wicked counsels of his brethren, and David, the injuries
inflicted on him by Semei.</p>

<p> Here also applies an argument which St. Chrysostom has ably
and learnedly handled. It is that no man is injured but by
himself. Let the man, who considers himself injured by another,
consider the matter in the right way and he will certainly find
that he has received no injury or loss from others. For although
he may have experienced injury from external causes, he is
himself his greatest enemy by wickedly staining his soul with
hatred, malevolence and envy.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Advantages Of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>The second consideration is that there are two advantages,
which are the special rewards of those, who, influenced by a holy
desire to please God, freely forgive injuries. In the first
place, God has promised that he who forgives, shall himself
obtain forgiveness of sins, a promise which clearly shows how
acceptable to God is this duty of piety. In the next place, the
forgiveness of injuries ennobles and perfects our nature; for by
it man is in some degree made like to God, Who maketh his sun to
shine on the good and the bad, and raineth upon the just and the
unjust.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Disadvantages Of Revenge</h3>

<p>Finally, the disadvantages which arise from the refusal to
pardon others are to be explained. The pastor, therefore, should
place before the eyes of the unforgiving man that hatred is not
only a grievous sin, but also that the longer it is indulged the
more deeply rooted it becomes. The man, of whose heart this
passion has once taken possession, thirsts for the blood of his
enemy. Filled with the hope of revenge, he will spend his days
and nights brooding over some evil design, so that his mind seems
never to rest from malignant projects, or even from thoughts of
blood. Thus it follows that never, or at least not without
extreme difficulty, can he be induced generously to pardon an
offence, or even to mitigate his hostility. Justly, therefore, is
hatred compared to a wound in which the weapon remains firmly
embedded.</p>

<p> Moreover, there are many evil consequences and sins which are
linked together with this one sin of hatred. Hence these words of
St. John: He that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh
in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the
darkness hath blinded his eyes. He must, therefore, frequently
fall; for how can anyone view in a favourable light the words or
actions of him whom he hates? Hence arise rash and unjust
judgments, anger, envy, detractions, and other evils of the same
sort, in which are often involved those who are connected by ties
of friendship or blood; and thus does it frequently happen that
this one sin is the prolific source of many.</p>

<p> Not without good reason is hatred called the sin of the
devil. The devil was a murderer from the beginning; and hence our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when the Pharisees sought His
life, said that they were begotten of their father the devil.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Remedies Against Hatred</h3>

<p>Besides the reasons already adduced, which afford good grounds
for detesting this sin, other and most suitable remedies are
prescribed in the pages of Holy Writ.</p>

<p> Of these remedies the first and greatest is the example of
the Redeemer, which we should set before our eyes as a model for
imitation. For He, in whom even suspicion of fault could not be
found, when scourged with rods, crowned with thorns, and finally
nailed to a cross, uttered that most charitable prayer: Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do. And as the Apostle
testifies: The sprinkling of his blood speaketh better than Abel.
</p>

<p> Another remedy, prescribed by Ecclesiasticus, is to call to
mind death and judgment: Remember thy last end, and. thou shalt
never sin.&quot; As if he had said: Reflect frequently and again
and again that you must soon die, and since at death there will
be nothing you desire or need more than great mercy from God,
that now you should keep that mercy always before your mind. Thus
the cruel desire for revenge will be extinguished; for you can
discover no means better adapted, none more efficacious to obtain
the mercy of God than the forgiveness of injuries and love
towards those who in word or deed may have injured you or yours.</p>
