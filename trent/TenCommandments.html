<h2><center>PART III: THE DECALOGUE</center></h2>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On The Commandments </h3>

<p>St. Augustine in his writings remarks that the Decalogue is
the summary and epitome of all laws: Although the Lord had spoken
many things, He gave to Moses only two stone tablets, called
&quot;tables of testimony,&quot; to be placed in the Ark. For if
carefully examined and well understood, whatever else is
commanded by God will be found to depend on the Ten Commandments
which were engraved on those two tables, just as these Ten
Commandments, in turn, are reducible to two, the love of God and
of our neighbour, on which &quot;depend the whole law and the
prophets.&quot;</p>

<p> Since, then, the Decalogue is a summary of the whole Law, the
pastor should give his days and nights to its consideration, that
he may be able not only to regulate his own life by its precepts,
but also to instruct in the law of God the people committed to
his care. The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they
shall seek the law at his mouth, because he is the angel of the
Lord of hosts. To the priests of the New Law this injunction
applies in a special manner; they are nearer to God, and should
be transformed from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.
Since Christ our Lord has called them light, it is their special
duty to be a light to them that are in darkness, the instructors
of the foolish, the teachers of infants; and if a man be
overtaken in any fault, they who are spiritual should instruct
such a one.</p>

<p> In the tribunal of penance the priest holds the place of a
judge, and pronounces sentence according to the nature and
gravity of the offence. Unless, therefore, he is desirous that
his ignorance should prove an injury to himself and to others, he
must bring with him to the discharge of this duty the greatest
vigilance and the most practiced acquaintance with the
interpretation of the law, in order to be able to pronounce,
according to this divine rule, on every act and omission; and, as
the Apostle says, to teach sound doctrine, free from error, and
heal the diseases of the soul, which are sins, in order that the
people may be acceptable to God, pursuers of good works.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Motives for Observing the Commandments</h3>

<p>In these instructions the pastor should propose to himself and
to others motives for keeping the Commandments</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God Is The Giver Of The Commandments</h3>

<p>Now among all the motives which induce men to obey this law
the strongest is that God is its author. True, it is said to have
been delivered by angels, but no one can doubt that its author is
God. This is most clear not only from the words of the Legislator
Himself, which we shall shortly explain, but also from
innumerable other passages of Scripture that will readily occur
to pastors. </p>

<p> Who is not conscious that a law is inscribed on his heart by
God, teaching him to distinguish good from evil, vice from
virtue, justice from injustice? The force and import of this
unwritten law do not conflict with that which is written. Who is
there, then, who will dare to deny that God is the author of the
written, as He is of the unwritten law ?</p>

<p> But, lest the people, aware of the abrogation of the Mosaic
Law, may imagine that the precepts of the Decalogue are no longer
obligatory, it should be taught that when God gave the Law to
Moses, He did not so much establish a new code, as render more
luminous that divine light b which the depraved morals and
long­continued perversity of man had at that time almost
obscured. It is most certain that we are not bound to obey the
Commandments because they were delivered by Moses, but because
they are implanted in the hearts of all, and have been explained
and confirmed by Christ our Lord.</p>

<p> The reflection that God is the author of the law is highly
useful, and exercises great influence in persuading (to its
observance); for we cannot doubt His wisdom and justice, nor can
we escape His infinite power and might. Hence, when by His
Prophets He commands the law to be observed, He proclaims that He
is the Lord God; and the Decalogue itself opens: I am the Lord
thy God; and elsewhere (we read): If I am a master, where is my
fear?</p>

<p> That God has deigned to make clear to us His holy will on
which depends our eternal salvation (is a consideration) which,
besides animating the faithful to the observance of His
Commandments, must call forth their gratitude Hence Scripture, in
more passages than one, recalling this great blessing, admonishes
the people to recognise their own dignity and the bounty of the
Lord Thus in Deuteronomy it is said: This is your wisdom and
understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these
precepts they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a
great nation; again, in the Psalm (we read): He hath not done in
like manner to every nation, and his judgments he hath not made
manifest to them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Commandments Were Proclaimed With Great Solemnity
</h3>

<p>If the pastor explain the circumstances which accompanied the
promulgation of the Law, as recorded in Scripture, the faithful
will easily understand with what piety and humility they should
receive and reverence the Law received from God.</p>

<p> All were commanded by God that for three days before the
promulgation of the Law they should wash their garments and
abstain from conjugal intercourse, in order that they might be
more holy and better prepared to receive the Law, and that on the
third day they should be in readiness When they had reached the
mountain from which the Lord was to deliver the Law by Moses,
Moses alone was commanded to ascend the mountain. Thither came
God with great majesty, filling the place with thunder and
lightning, with fire and dense clouds, and began to speak to
Moses, and delivered to him the Commandments </p>

<p> In this the divine wisdom had solely for object to admonish
us that the law of the Lord should be received with pure and
humble minds, and that over the neglect of His commands impend
the heaviest chastisements of the divine justice.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Observance Of The Commandments Is Not Difficult </h3>

<p>The pastor should also teach that the Commandments of God are
not difficult, as these words of St Augustine are alone
sufficient to show: How, I ask, is it said to be impossible for
man to love ­­ to love, I say, a beneficent Creator, a most
loving Father, and also, in the persons of his , brethren to love
his own flesh? Yet, &quot;he who loveth has fulfilled the
law.&quot; Hence the Apostle St. John expressly says that the
commandments of God are not heavy; for as St. Bernard observes,
nothing more just could be exacted from man, nothing that could
confer on him a more exalted dignity, nothing more advantageous.
Hence St. Augustine, filled with admiration of God's infinite
goodness, thus addresses God : What is man that Thou wouldst be
loved by him ? And if he loves Thee not, Thou threatenest t him
with heavy punishment. Is it not punishment enough that I love
Thee not ?</p>

<p> But should anyone plead human infirmity to excuse himself for
not loving God, it should be explained that He who demands our
love pours into our hearts by the Holy Ghost the fervour of His
love; and this good Spirit our heavenly Father gives to those
that ask him with reason, therefore, did St. Augustine pray: Give
what thou commandest and command what thou pleasest. As, then,
God is ever ready to help us, especially since the death of
Christ the Lord, by which the prince of this world was cast out,
there is no reason why anyone should be disheartened by the
difficulty of the undertaking. To him who loves, nothing is
difficult. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Observance Of The Commandments Is Necessary </h3>

<p>Furthermore, it will contribute much to persuade (obedience to
the law) if it is explained that such obedience is necessary,
especially since in these our days there are not wanting those
who, to their own serious injury, have the impious hardihood to
assert that the observance of the law, whether easy or difficult,
is by no means necessary to salvation.</p>

<p> This wicked and impious error the pastor should refute from
Scripture, especially from the same Apostle by whose authority
they attempt to defend their wickedness. What, then, are the
words of the Apostle? Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision
is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Again,
inculcating the same doctrine, he says: , new creature, in
Christ, alone avails. By a new creature in Christ he evidently
means him who observes the Commandments of God; for, he who
observes the Commandments of God loves God, as our Lord Himself
testifies in St. John: If anyone love me, he will keep my word.</p>

<p> A man, it is true, may be justified, and from wicked may
become righteous, before he has fulfilled, by external acts, each
of the Commandments; but no one who has arrived at the use of
reason can be justified, unless he is resolved to keep all of
God's Commandments. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Observance Of The Commandments Is Attended By
Many Blessings </h3>

<p>Finally, to leave nothing unsaid that may be calculated to
induce the faithful to an observance of the law, the pastor
should point out how abundant and sweet are its fruits. This he
will easily accomplish by referring to the eighteenth Psalm,
which celebrates the praises of the divine law. The highest
eulogy of the law is that it proclaims the glory and the majesty
of God more eloquently than even the heavenly bodies, whose
beauty and order excite the admiration of all peoples, even the
most uncivilised, and compel them to acknowledge the glory,
wisdom and power of the Creator and Architect of the universe.</p>

<p> The law of the Lord also converts souls to God; for knowing
the ways of God and His holy will through the medium of His law,
we turn our steps into the ways of the Lord.</p>

<p> It also gives wisdom to little ones; for they alone who fear
God are truly wise. Hence, the observers of the law of God are
filled with pure delights, with knowledge of divine mysteries,
and are blessed with plenteous joys and rewards both in this life
and in the life to come.</p>

<p> In our observance of the law, however, we should not act so
much for our own advantage as for the sake of God who, by means
of the law, has revealed His will to man. If other creatures are
obedient to God's will, how much more reasonable that man should
follow it?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God's Goodness Invites Us To Keep His Commandments </h3>

<p>Nor should it be omitted that God has preeminently displayed
His clemency and the riches of His goodness in this, that while
He might have forced us to serve His glory without a reward, He
has, notwithstanding, deigned to identify His own glory with our
advantage, thus rendering what tends to His honour, conducive to
our interests. </p>

<p> This is a great and striking consideration; and the pastor,
therefore, should teach in the concluding words of the Prophet
that in keeping them there is a great reward. Not only are we
promised those blessings which seem to have reference to earthly
happiness, such, for example, as to be blessed in the city, and
blessed in the field: but we are also promised a great reward in
heaven, good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running
over, which, aided by the divine mercy, we merit by our holy and
pious actions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Promulgation of the Law</h3>

<p>I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt not have strange
gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing.
The Law, although delivered to the Jews by the Lord from the
mountain, was long before written and impressed by nature on the
heart of man, and was therefore rendered obligatory by God for
all men and all times.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The People To Whom The Law Was Given</h3>

<p>It will be very useful, however, to explain carefully the
words in which it was proclaimed to the Hebrews by Moses, its
minister and interpreter, and also the history of the Israelites,
which is so full of mysteries.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Epitome Of Jewish History</h3>

<p>(The pastor) should first tell that from among the nations of
the earth God chose one which descended from Abraham; that it was
the divine will that Abraham should be a stranger in the land of
Canaan, the possession of which He had promised him; and that,
although for more than four hundred years he and his posterity
were wanderers before they dwelt in the promised land, God never
withdrew from them, throughout their wanderings, His protecting
care. They passed from nation to nation and from one kingdom to
another people; He suffered no man to hurt them, and He even
reproved kings for their sakes.</p>

<p> Before they went down into Egypt He sent before them one by
whose prudence they and the Egyptians were rescued from famine.
In Egypt such was His kindness towards them that although opposed
by the power of Pharaoh who sought their destruction, they
increased to an extraordinary degree; and when they were severely
harassed and cruelly treated as slaves, God raised up Moses as a
leader to lead them out in a strong hand. It is especially this
deliverance that the Lord refers to in the opening words of the
Law: I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Lessons To Be Drawn From Jewish History</h3>

<p>From all this the pastor should especially note that out of
all the nations God chose only one whom He called His people, and
by whom He willed to be known and worshipped; not that they were
superior to other nations in justice or in numbers, and of this
God Himself reminds the Hebrews, but rather because He wished, by
the multiplication and aggrandisement of an inconsiderable and
impoverished nation, to display to mankind His power and
goodness. </p>

<p> Such having been their condition, he was closely united to
them, and loved them, and Lord of heaven and earth as He was, He
disdained not to be called their God. He desired that the other
nations might thus be excited to emulation and that mankind,
seeing the happiness of the Israelites, might embrace the worship
of the true God. In the same way St. Paul says that by discussing
the happiness of the Gentiles and their knowledge of the true
God, he provoked to emulation those who were his own flesh.</p>

<p> The faithful should next be taught that God suffered the
Hebrew Patriarchs to wander for so long a time, and their
posterity to be oppressed and harassed by a galling servitude, in
order to teach us that none are friends of God except those who
are enemies of the world and pilgrims on earth, and that an
entire detachment from the world gives us an easier access to the
friendship of God. Further He wished that, being brought to His
service, we should understand how much happier are they who serve
God, than they who serve the world. Of this Scripture itself
admonishes us: Yet they shall serve him, that they may know the
difference between my service and the service of the kingdom of
the earth. </p>

<p> (The pastor) should also explain that God delayed the
fulfilment of His promise until after the lapse of more than four
hundred years, in order that His people might be sustained by
faith and hope; for, as we shall show when we come to explain the
first Commandment, God wishes His children to depend on Him at
all times and to repose all their confidence in His goodness. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Time And Place In Which The Law Was Promulgated </h3>

<p>Finally, the time and place, in which the people of Israel
received this Law from God should be noted. They received it
after they had been delivered from Egypt and had come into the
wilderness; in order that, impressed by the memory of a recent
benefit and awed by the dreariness of the place in which they
journeyed, they might be the better disposed to receive the Law.
For man becomes closely attached to those whose bounty he has
experienced, and when he has lost all hope of assistance from his
fellow­man, he then seeks refuge in the protection of God.</p>

<p> From all this we learn that the more detached the faithful
are from the allurements of the world and the pleasures of sense,
the more disposed they are to accept heavenly doctrines. As the
Prophet has written: Whom shall he teach knowledge, and whom
shall he make to understand the hearing? Them that are weaned
from the milk, that are drawn away from the breasts.</p>
