<h3><center>THE SEAL OF THE LORD'S PRAYER</center></h3>

<h3><p>&quot;Amen&quot;</p></h3>

<h3>Necessity Of Explaining The Conclusion Of The Lord's
Prayer </h3>

<p>St. Jerome in his commentary on St. Matthew rightly calls this
word what it really is, the seal of the Lord's Prayer. As then we
have already admonished the faithful with regard to the
preparation to be made before this holy prayer, so we deem it
necessary that they should also know why we close our prayers
with this word, and what it signifies; for devotion in concluding
our prayers is not less important than attention in beginning
them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>fruits that Come at the Conclusion of Prayer </h3>

<h3>Assurance That We Have Been Heard</h3>

<p>The faithful, then, should be taught that the fruits, which we
gather from the conclusion of the Lord's Prayer are numerous and
abundant, the greatest and most joyful of them being the
attainment of what we ask. On this point enough has already been
said.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fervour And Illumination</h3>

<p>By this concluding word, not only do we obtain a propitious
hearing from God, but also receive other blessings of a higher
order still, the excellence of which surpasses all powers of
description.</p>

<p> For since, as St. Cyprian remarks, by prayer man converses
with God, it happens in a wonderful manner that the divine
Majesty is brought nearer to those who are engaged in prayer than
to others, and enriches them with singular gifts. Those,
therefore, who pray devoutly, may not be inaptly compared to
persons who approach a glowing fire; if cold, they derive warmth;
if warm, they derive heat. Thus, also, those who approach God (in
prayer) depart with a warmth proportioned to their faith and
fervour; the heart is inflamed with zeal for the glory of God,
the mind is illumined after an admirable manner, and they are
enriched exceedingly with divine gifts, as it is written: Thou
hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness.</p>

<p> An example for all is that great man Moses. By intercourse
and converse with God he so shone with the reflected splendours
of the Divinity, that the Israelites could not look upon his eyes
or countenance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sweetness</h3>

<p>Those who pray with such vehement fervour enjoy in a wonderful
manner the goodness and majesty of God. In the morning, says the
Prophet, I will stand before thee, and will see; because thou art
not a God that willest iniquity.</p>

<p> The more familiar these truths are to the mind, the more
piously do we venerate, and the more fervently do we worship God,
and the more delightfully do we taste how sweet is the Lord, and
how truly blessed are all who hope in Him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Confidence And Gratitude</h3>

<p>Encircled by the most clear light from above we also discover
our own lowliness and how exalted is the majesty of God,
according to the saying of St. Augustine: Give me to know Thee:
give me to know myself. Distrusting our own strength, we thus
throw ourselves unreservedly upon the goodness of God, not
doubting that He, who cherishes us in the bosom of His paternal
wondrous love, will afford us in abundance whatever is necessary
for life and salvation. Thus we shall turn to God with the
warmest gratitude our hearts can conceive and our lips express.
This we read that holy David did, who commenced by praying: Save
me from all them that persecute me, and concluded with these
words, I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice,
and will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Illustrations From The Psalms</h3>

<p>There are innumerable prayers of the Saints of the same kind,
whose beginnings are full of fear, but which end with hope and
joy. This spirit, however, is eminently conspicuous in the
prayers of David.</p>

<p> When agitated by fear he began his prayer thus: Many are they
who rise up against me: many say to my soul, There is no
salvation for him in his God; but at length, armed with fortitude
and holy joy, he adds: I will not fear thousands of the people
surrounding me.</p>

<p> In another Psalm, after he had lamented his misery, we see
him towards the end, reposing confidence in God and rejoicing
exceedingly in the hope of salvation: In peace in the self­same,
I will sleep, and I will rest.</p>

<p> Again, with what fear and trembling must the Prophet not have
been agitated when he exclaimed: O Lord, rebuke me not in thy
indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath! Yet, on the other
hand, what confidence and joy must not have been his when he
added: Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord
hath heard the voice of my weeping! </p>

<p> When filled with dread of the wrath and fury of Saul, with
what lowliness and humility does he not implore the divine
assistance: Save me, O Lord, by thy name, and Judge me in thy
strength! and yet, in the same Psalm he adds these words of joy
and confidence: Behold, God is my help; and the Lord is the
helper of my soul. </p>

<p> Let him, therefore, who has recourse to holy prayer approach
God his Father, fortified by faith and animated by hope, not
doubting that he will obtain those blessings of which he stands
in need. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning of the Word &quot;Amen&quot;</h3>

<h3>First Explanation</h3>

<p>The word amen, with which the Lord's Prayer concludes,
contains, as it were, the germs of many of these thoughts and
reflections which we nave just considered. Indeed, so frequent
was this Hebrew word in the mouth of the Saviour, that it pleased
the Holy Ghost to have it retained in the Church of God. Its
meaning may be said to be: Know that thy prayers are heard. It
has the force of a response, as if God answers the suppliant, and
graciously dismisses him, after having favourably heard his
prayers.</p>

<p> This­interpretation has been approved by the constant usage
of the Church of God. In the Sacrifice of the Mass, when the
Lord's Prayer is said she does not assign the word amen to the
server who answers: But deliver us front evil. She reserves it as
appropriate to the priest himself, who, as mediator between God
and man, answers Amen, thus intimating that God has heard the
prayers of His people. </p>

<p> This practice, however, is not common to all the prayers, but
is peculiar to the Lord's Prayer. To the other prayers the server
answers Amen, because in every other this word only expresses
assent and desire. In the Lord's Prayer it is an answer,
intimating that God has heard the petition of His suppliant.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Explanations Of The Word &quot;Amen&quot; </h3>

<p>By many, the word amen is differently interpreted. The
Septuagint interprets it, So be it; others translate it, Verily:
Aquila renders it, Faithfully. Which of these versions we adopt,
is a matter of little importance, provided we understand the word
to have the sense already mentioned, namely, that when the priest
(pronounces Amen), it signifies the concession of what hag been
prayed for. This interpretation is supported by St­ Paul in his
Epistle to the Corinthians, where he says: All the promises of
God are in him, &quot;it is&quot;; therefore also by him, amen to
God, unto our glory.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Advantages of Terminating our Prayer with this Word</h3>

<p>To us also this word is very appropriate, containing, as it
does, some confirmation of the Petitions which we have already
offered up. It also fixes our attention when we are engaged in
holy prayer; for it frequently happens that in prayer a variety
of distracting thoughts divert the mind to other objects.</p>

<p> Nay, more, by this word we most earnestly beg of God that all
our preceding Petitions may be granted; or rather, understanding
that they have been all granted, and feeling the divine
assistance powerfully present with us, we cry out together with
the Prophet: Behold God is my helper; and the Lord is the
protector of my soul. </p>

<p> Nor can anyone doubt that God is moved by the name of His
Son, and by a word so often uttered by Him who, as the Apostle
says, was always heard for his reverence.</p>
