<h3><center>ARTICLE IV : &quot;SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS
PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DEAD, AND BURIED'&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>How necessary is a knowledge of this Article, and how
assiduous the pastor should be in stirring up in the minds of the
faithful the frequent recollection of our Lord's Passion&quot; we
learn from the Apostle when he says that he knows nothing but
Jesus Christ and him crucified.' The pastor, therefore, should
exercise the greatest care and pains in giving a thorough
explanation of this subject&quot; in order that the
faithful&quot; being moved by the remembrance of so great a
benefit&quot; may give themselves entirely to the contemplation
of the goodness and love of God towards us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part of this Article: '&quot;Suffered Under
Pontius Pilate, was Crucified,</h3>

<p>The first part of this Article (of the second we shall treat
hereafter) proposes for our belief that when Pontius Pilate
governed the province of Judea&quot; under Tiberius Caesar&quot;
Christ the Lord was nailed to a cross. Having been seized&quot;
mocked, outraged and tortured in various forms&quot; He was
finally crucified. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Suffered,&quot;</h3>

<p>It cannot be a matter of doubt that His soul&quot; as to its
inferior part&quot; was sensible of these torments; for as He
really assumed human nature&quot; it is a necessary consequence
that He really, and in His soul, experienced a most acute sense
of pain. Hence these words of the Saviour: My soul is sorrowful
even unto death. </p>

<p> Although human nature was united to the Divine Person, He
felt the bitterness of His Passion as acutely as if no such union
had existed&quot; because in the one Person of Jesus Christ were
preserved the properties of both natures&quot; human and divine;
and therefore what was passible and mortal remained passible and
mortal; while what was impassible and immortal, that is, His
Divine Nature, continued impassible and immortal.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Under Pontius Pilate&quot;</h3>

<p>Since we find it here so diligently recorded that Jesus Christ
suffered when Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judea, the pastor
should explain the reason. By fixing the time, which we find also
done by the Apostle Paul, so important and so necessary an event
is rendered more easily ascertainable by all. Furthermore those
words show that the Saviour's prediction was really verified:
They shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to be mocked and scourged
and crucified.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Was Crucified&quot;</h3>

<p>The fact that He suffered death precisely on the wood of the
cross must also be attributed to a particular counsel of God,
which decreed that life should return by the way whence death had
arisen The serpent who had triumphed over our first parents by
the wood (of a tree) was vanquished by Christ on the wood of the
cross. </p>

<p> Many other reasons which the Fathers have discussed in detail
might be adduced to show that it was fit that our Redeemer should
suffer death on the cross rather than in any other way. But, as
the pastor will show&quot; it is enough for the faithful to
believe that this kind of death was chosen by the Saviour because
it appeared better adapted and more appropriate to the redemption
of the human race; for there certainly could be none more
ignominious and humiliating. Not only among the Gentiles was the
punishment of the cross held accursed and full of shame and
infamy, but even in the Law of Moses the man is called accursed
that hangeth on a tree.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance Of The History Of The Passion</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the pastor should not omit the historical part of
this Article, which has been so carefully set forth by the holy
Evangelists; so that the faithful may be acquainted with at least
the principal points of this mystery, that is to say, such as
seem more necessary to confirm the truth of our faith. For it is
on this Article, as on their foundation, that the Christian faith
and religion rest; and if this truth be firmly established, all
the rest is secure. Indeed, if one thing more than another
presents difficulty to the mind and understanding of man,
assuredly it is the mystery of the cross, which, beyond all
doubt, must be considered the most difficult of all; so much so
that only with great difficulty can we grasp the fact that our
salvation depends on the cross, and on Him who for us was nailed
thereon. In this, however, as the Apostle teaches, we may well
admire the wonderful Providence of God; for, seeing that in the
wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God
by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. It is
no wonder, then, that the Prophets, before the coming of Christ,
and the Apostles, after His death and Resurrection, labored so
strenuously to convince mankind that He was the Redeemer of the
world, and to bring them under the power and obedience of the
Crucified.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Figures And Prophecies Of The Passion And Death Of
The Saviour </h3>

<p>Since, therefore, nothing is so far above the reach of human
reason as the mystery of the cross, the Lord immediately after
the fall ceased not, both by figures and prophecies, to signify
the death by which His Son was to die.</p>

<p> To mention a few of these types. First of all, Abel, who fell
a victim of the envy of his brother, Isaac who was commanded to
be offered in sacrifice, the lamb immolated by the Jews on their
departure from Egypt, and also the brazen serpent lifted up by
Moses in the desert, were all figures of the Passion and death of
Christ the Lord.</p>

<p> As to the Prophets, how many there were who foretold Christ's
Passion and death is too well known to require development here.
Not to speak of David, whose Psalms embrace all the principal
mysteries of Redemption, the oracles of Isaias in particular are
so clear and graphic that he might be said rather to have
recorded a past than predicted a future event. a</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part Of This Article: &quot;Dead, And
Buried&quot; </h3>

<h3>Christ Really Died</h3>

<p>The pastor should explain that these words present for our
belief that Jesus Christ, after He was crucified, really died and
was buried. It is not without just reason that this is proposed
to the faithful as a separate object of belief, since there were
some who denied His death upon the cross. The Apostles,
therefore, were justly of opinion that to such an error should be
opposed the doctrine of faith contained in this Article, the
truth of which is placed beyond the possibility of doubt by the
united testimony of all the Evangelists, who record that Jesus
yielded up the ghost.</p>

<p> Moreover as Christ was true and perfect man, He of course was
capable of dying. Now man dies when the soul is separated from
the body. When, therefore, we say that Jesus died, we mean that
His soul was disunited from His body. We do not admit, however,
that the Divinity was separated from His body. On the contrary,
we firmly believe and profess that when His soul was dissociated
from His body, His Divinity continued always united both to His
body in the sepulchre and to His soul in limbo. It became the Son
of God to die, that, through death, he might destroy him who had
the empire of death that is the devil, and might deliver them,
who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to
servitude.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ Died Freely</h3>

<p>It was the peculiar privilege of Christ the Lord to have died
when He Himself decreed to die, and to have died not so much by
external violence as by internal assent. Not only His death, but
also its time and place, were ordained by Him. For thus Isaias
wrote: He was offered because it was his own will. The Lord
before His Passion, declared the same of Himself: I lay down my
life, that I may take it again. No man taketh it away from me:
but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and
I have power to take it again. As to the time and place of His
death, He said, when Herod insidiously sought His life: Go and
tell that fox: Behold I cast out devils, and do cures to­day and
to­morrow, and the third day I am consummated. Nevertheless I
must walk today and to­morrow, and the day following, because it
cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.'' He therefore
offered Himself not involuntarily or by compulsion but of His own
free will. Going to meet His enemies He said: I am he; and all
the punishments which injustice and cruelty inflicted on Him He
endured voluntarily.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Thought Of Christ's Death Should Excite Our Love
And Gratitude </h3>

<p>When we meditate on the sufferings and all the torments of the
Redeemer, nothing is better calculated to stir our souls than the
thought that He endured them thus voluntarily. Were anyone to
endure all kinds of suffering for our sake, not because he chose
them but simply because he could not escape them, we should not
consider this a very great favour; but were he to endure death
freely, and for our sake only, having had it in his power to
avoid it, this indeed would be a benefit so overwhelming as to
deprive even the most grateful heart, not only of the power of
returning but even of feeling due thanks. We may hence form an
idea of the transcendent and intense love of Jesus Christ towards
us, and of His divine and boundless claims to our gratitude.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ Was Really Buried</h3>

<p>When we confess that He was buried, we do not make this, as it
were, a distinct part of the Article, as if it presented any new
difficulty which is not implied in what we have said of His
death; for if we believe that Christ died, we can also easily
believe that He was buried. The word buried was added in the
Creed, first, that His death might be rendered more certain, for
the strongest argument of a person's death is the proof that his
body was buried; and, secondly, to render the miracle of His
Resurrection more authentic and illustrious.</p>

<p> It is not, however, our belief that the body of Christ alone
was interred. The above words propose, as the principal object of
our belief, that God was buried; as according to the rule of
Catholic faith we also say with the strictest truth that God
died, and that God was born of a virgin. For as the Divinity was
never separated from His body which was laid in the sepulchre, we
truly confess that God was buried.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Circumstances Of Christ's Burial</h3>

<p>As to the manner and place of His burial, what the holy
Evangelists record on these subjects will be sufficient for the
pastor. There are, however, two things which demand particular
attention; the one, that the body of Christ was in no degree
corrupted in the sepulchre, according to the prediction of the
Prophet: Thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption; the
other, and it regards the several parts of this Article, that
burial, Passion, and also death, apply to Christ Jesus not as God
but as man. To suffer and die are incidental to human nature
only; yet they are also attributed to God, since, as is clear,
they are predicated with propriety of that Person who is at once
perfect God and perfect man.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Useful Considerations on the Passion</h3>

<p>When the faithful have once attained the knowledge of these
things, the pastor should next proceed to explain those
particulars of the Passion and death of Christ which may enable
them if not to comprehend, at least to contemplate, the immensity
of so stupendous a mystery.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Dignity Of The Sufferer</h3>

<p>And first we must consider who it is that suffers all these
things. His dignity we cannot express in words or even conceive
in mind. Of Him St. John says, that He is the Word which was with
God. And the Apostle describes Him in sublime terms, saying that
this is He ­whom God hath appointed heir of all things, by whom
also he made the world, who being the brightness of his glory,
and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things by the
word of his power, making purgation of sins. sitteth on the right
hand of the majesty on high. In a word, Jesus Christ, the
God­man, suffers ! The Creator suffers for His creatures, the
Master for His servant. He suffers by whom the Angels, men, the
heavens, and the elements were made; in whom, by whom, and of
whom, are all things.</p>

<p> It cannot, therefore, be a matter of surprise that while He
agonised under such an accumulation of torments the whole frame
of the universe was convulsed; for as the Scriptures inform us,
the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent, there was darkness
over all the earth; and the sun was obscured. If, then, even mute
and inanimate nature sympathised with the sufferings of her
Creator, let the faithful consider with what tears they, the
living stones of this edifice, should manifest their sorrow.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reasons Why Christ Suffered</h3>

<p>The reasons why the Saviour suffered are also to be explained,
that thus the greatness and intensity of the divine love towards
us may the more fully appear. Should anyone inquire why the Son
of God underwent His most bitter Passion, he will find that
besides the guilt inherited from our first parents the principal
causes were the vice's and crimes which have been perpetrated
from the beginning of the world to the present day and those
which will be committed to the end of time. In His Passion and
death the Son of God, our Saviour, intended to atone for and blot
out the sins of all ages, to offer for them to his Father a full
and abundant satisfaction.</p>

<p> Besides, to increase the dignity of this mystery, Christ not
only suffered for sinners, but even for those who were the very
authors and ministers of all the torments He endured. Of this the
Apostle reminds us in these words addressed to the Hebrews: Think
diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners
against himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.
In this guilt are involved all those who fall frequently into
sin; for, as our sins consigned Christ the Lord to the death of
the cross, most certainly those who wallow in sin and iniquity
crucify to themselves again the Son of God, as far as in them
lies, and make a mockery of Him. This guilt seems more enormous
in us than in the Jews, since according to the testimony of the
same Apostle: If they had known it, they would never have
crucified the Lord of glory; while we, on the contrary,
professing to know Him, yet denying Him by our actions, seem in
some sort to lay violent hands on him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ Was Delivered Over To Death By The Father And
By Himself </h3>

<p>But that Christ the Lord was also delivered over to death by
the Father and by Himself, the Scriptures bear witness. For in
Isaias (God the Father) says For the wickedness of my people have
I struck him. And a little before the same Prophet filled with
the Spirit of God, cried out, as he saw the Lord covered with
stripes and wounds: All we like sheep have gone astray, every one
hath turned aside into his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him
the iniquity of us all. But of the Son it is written: If he shall
lay down his life for sin, he shall see a long­lived seed. This
the Apostle expresses in language still stronger when, in order
to show how confidently we, on our part, should trust in the
boundless mercy and goodness of God, he says: He that spared not
even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he
not also, with him, given us all things? a</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The: Bitterness Of Christ's Passion</h3>

<p>The next subject of the pastor's instruction is the bitterness
of the Redeemer's Passion. If we bear m mind that his sweat
became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground, and
this, at the sole anticipation of the torments and agony which He
was about to endure, we must at once perceive that His sorrows
admitted of no increase. For if the very idea of impending evils
was overwhelming, and the sweat of blood shows that it was, what
are we to suppose their actual endurance to have been ?</p>

<p> That Christ our Lord suffered the most excruciating torments
of mind and body is certain. In the first place, there was no
part of His body that did not experience the most agonising
torture. His hands and feet were fastened with nails to the
cross; His head was pierced with thorns and smitten with a reed;
His face was befouled with spittle and buffeted with blows; His
whole body was covered with stripes.</p>

<p> Furthermore men of all ranks and conditions were gathered
together against the Lord, and against his Christ. Gentiles and
Jews were the advisers, the authors, the ministers of His
Passion: Judas betrayed Him, Peter denied Him, all the rest
deserted Him.</p>

<p> And while He hangs from the cross are we not at a loss which
to deplore, His agony, or His ignominy, or both? Surely no death
more shameful, none more cruel, could have been devised than
this. It was the punishment usually reserved for the most guilty
and atrocious malefactors, a death whose slowness aggravated the
exquisite pain and torture I</p>

<p> His agony was increased by the very constitution and frame of
His body. Formed by the power of the Holy Ghost, it was more
perfect and better organised than the bodies of other men can be,
and was therefore endowed with a superior susceptibility and a
keener sense of all the torments which it endured.</p>

<p> And as to His interior anguish of soul, that too was no doubt
extreme; for those among the Saints who had to endure torments
and tortures were not without consolation from above, which
enabled them not only to bear their sufferings patiently, but in
many instances, to feel, in the very midst of them, filled with
interior joy. I rejoice, says the Apostle, in my sufferings for
you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings
of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church;' and
in another place: I am filled with comfort, I exceedingly abound
with joy in all our tribulations. Christ our Lord tempered with
no admixture of sweetness the bitter chalice of His Passion but
permitted His human nature to feel as acutely every species of
torment as if He were only man, and not also God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fruits Of Christ's Passion</h3>

<p>It only remains now that the pastor carefully explain the
blessings and advantages which flow from the Passion of Christ.
In the first place, then, the Passion of our Lord was our
deliverance from sin; for, as St. John says, He hath loved us,
and washed us from our sins in his own blood. He hath quickened
you together with him, says the Apostle, forgiving you all
offences, blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was
against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same
out of the way, fastening it to the cross.</p>

<p> In the next place He has rescued us from the tyranny of the
devil, for our Lord Himself says: Now is the judgment of the
world; now shall the prance of this world be cast out. And I if I
be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself. </p>

<p> Again He discharged the punishment due to our sins. And as no
sacrifice more pleasing and acceptable could have been offered to
God, He reconciled us to the Father, appeased His wrath, and made
Him favourable to us.</p>

<p> Finally, by taking away our sins He opened to us heaven,
which was closed by the common sin of mankind. And this the
Apostle pointed out when he said: We have confidence in the
entering into the holies by the blood of Christ. Nor are we
without a type and figure of this mystery in the Old Law. For
those who were prohibited to return into their native country
before the death of the high­priest typified that no one,
however just and holy may have been his life, could gain
admission into the celestial country until the eternal
High­priest, Christ Jesus, had died, and by His death
immediately opened heaven to those who, purified by the
Sacraments and gifted with faith, hope, and charity, become
partakers of His Passion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ's Passion, -- A Satisfaction, A Sacrifice, A
Redemption An Example</h3>

<p>The pastor should teach that all these inestimable and divine
blessings flow to us from the Passion of Christ. First, indeed,
because the satisfaction which Jesus Christ has in an admirable
manner made to God the Father for our sins is full and complete.
The price which He paid for our ransom was not only adequate and
equal to our debts, but far exceeded them.</p>

<p> Again, it (the Passion of Christ) was a sacrifice most
acceptable to God, for when offered by His Son on the altar of
the cross, it entirely appeased the wrath and indignation of the
Father. This word (sacrifice) the Apostle uses when he says:
Christ hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an
oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.</p>

<p> Furthermore, it was a redemption, of which the Prince of the
Apostles says: You were not redeemed with corruptible things as
gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of
your fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
unspotted and undefiled. While the Apostle teaches: Christ hath
redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.</p>

<p> Besides these incomparable blessings, we have also received
another of the highest importance; namely, that in the Passion
alone we have the most illustrious example of the exercise of
every virtue. For He so displayed patience, humility, exalted
charity, meekness, obedience and unshaken firmness of soul, not
only in suffering for justice, sake, but also in meeting death,
that we may truly say on the day of His Passion alone, our
Saviour offered, in His own Person, a living exemplification of
all the moral precepts inculcated during the entire time of His
public ministry.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Admonition</h3>

<p>This exposition of the saving Passion and death of Christ the
Lord we have given briefly. Would to God that these mysteries
were always present to our minds, and that we learned to suffer,
die, and be buried together with our Lord; so that from
henceforth, having cast aside all stain of sin, and rising with
Him to newness of life, we may at length, through His grace and
mercy, be found worthy to be made partakers of the celestial
kingdom and glory !</p>
