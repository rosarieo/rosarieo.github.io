<h3><center>ARTICLE V : &quot;HE DESCENDED INTO HELL, THE
THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>To know the glory of the burial of our Lord Jesus Christ, of
which we last treated, is highly important; but of still higher
importance is it to the faithful to know the splendid triumphs
which He obtained by having subdued the devil and despoiled the
abodes of hell. Of these triumphs, and also of His Resurrection,
we are now about to speak.</p>

<p> Although the latter presents to us a subject which might with
propriety be treated under a separate and distinct head, yet
following the example of the holy Fathers, we have deemed it
fitting to unite it with His descent into hell.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part of this Article: &quot;He Descended into
Hell&quot; </h3>

<p>In the first part of this Article, then, we profess that
immediately after the death of Christ His soul descended into
hell, and dwelt there as long as His body remained in the tomb;
and also that the one Person of Christ was at the same time in
hell and in the sepulchre. Nor should this excite surprise; for,
as we have already frequently said, although His soul was
separated from His body, His Divinity was never parted from
either His soul or His body. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Hell&quot;</h3>

<p>As the pastor, by explaining the meaning of the word hell in
this place may throw considerable light on the exposition of this
Article, it is to be observed that by the word hell is not here
meant the sepulchre, as some have not less impiously than
ignorantly imagined; for in the preceding Article we learned that
Christ the Lord was buried, and there was no reason why the
Apostles, in delivering an Article of faith, should repeat the
same thing in other and more obscure terms.</p>

<p> Hell, then, here signifies those secret abodes in which are
detained the souls that have not obtained the happiness of
heaven. In this sense the word is frequently used in Scripture.
Thus the Apostle says: At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
of those that are in heaven, on earth, and in hell; and in the
Acts of the Apostles St. Peter says that Christ the Lord is again
risen, having loosed the sorrows of hell.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Different Abodes Called Hell&quot;</h6>

<p> These abodes are not all of the same nature, for among them
is that most loathsome and dark prison in which the souls of the
damned are tormented with the unclean spirits in eternal and
inextinguishable fire. This place is called gehenna, the
bottomless pit, and is hell strictly soÂ­called.</p>

<p> Among them is also the fire of purgatory, in which the souls
of just men are cleansed by a temporary punishment, in order to
be admitted into their eternal country, into which nothing
defiled entereth. The truth of this doctrine, founded, as holy
Councils declare,' on Scripture, and confirmed by Apostolic
tradition, demands exposition from the pastor, all the more
diligent and frequent, because we live in times when men endure
not sound doctrine.</p>

<p> Lastly, the third kind of abode is that into which the souls
of the just before the coming of Christ the Lord, were received,
and where, without experiencing any sort of pain, but supported
by the blessed hope of redemption, they enjoyed peaceful repose.
To liberate these holy souls, who, in the bosom of Abraham were
expecting the Saviour, Christ the Lord descended into hell. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;He Descended&quot;</h3>

<p>We are not to imagine that His power and virtue only, and not
also His soul, descended into hell; but we are firmly to believe
that His soul itself, really and substantially, descended
thither, according to this conclusive testimony of David: Thou
wilt not leave my soul in hell.</p>

<p> But although Christ descended into hell, His supreme power
was in no degree lessened, nor was the splendour of His sanctity
obscured by any blemish. His descent served rather to prove that
whatever had been foretold of His sanctity was true; and that, as
He had previously demonstrated by so many miracles, He was truly
the Son of God.</p>

<p> This we shall easily understand by comparing the causes of
the descent of Christ with those of other men. They descended as
captives; He as free and victorious among the dead, to subdue
those demons by whom, in consequence of guilt, they were held in
captivity. Furthermore all others descended, either to endure the
most acute torments, or, if exempt from other pain, to be
deprived of the vision of God, and to be tortured by the delay of
the glory and happiness for which they yearned; Christ the Lord
descended, on the contrary, not to suffer, but to liberate the
holy and the just from their painful captivity, and to impart to
them the fruit of His Passion. His supreme dignity and power,
therefore, suffered no diminution by His descent into hell.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why He Descended into Hell</h3>

<h6>To Liberate The Just</h6>

<p> Having explained these things, the pastor should next proceed
to teach that Christ the Lord descended into hell, in order that
having despoiled the demons, He might liberate from prison those
holy Fathers and the other just souls, and might bring them into
heaven with Himself. This He accomplished in an admirable and
most glorious manner; for His august presence at once shed a
celestial lustre upon the captives and filled them with
inconceivable joy and delight. He also imparted to them that
supreme happiness which consists in the vision of God, thus
verifying His promise to the thief on the cross: This day thou
shalt be with me in paradise.</p>

<p> This deliverance of the just was long before predicted by
Osee in these words: O death, I will be thy death; O hell, I will
be thy bite; ' and also by the Prophet Zachary: Thou also by the
blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the
pit, wherein is no water; and lastly, the same is expressed by
the Apostle in these words: Despoiling the principalities and
powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing
over them in himself.</p>

<p> But the better to understand the efficacy of this mystery we
should frequently call to mind that not only the just who were
born after the coming of our Lord, but also those who preceded
Him from the days of Adam, or who shall be born until the end of
time, obtain their salvation through the benefit of His Passion.
Wherefore before His death and Resurrection heaven was closed
against every child of Adam. The souls of the just, on their
departure from this life, were either borne to the bosom of
Abraham; or, as is still the case with those who have something
to be washed away or satisfied for, were purified in the fire of
purgatory.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>To Proclaim His Power</h6>

<p> Another reason why Christ the Lord descended into hell is
that there, as well as in heaven and on earth, He might proclaim
His power and authority, and that every knee should bow, of those
that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.</p>

<p> And here, who is not filled with admiration and astonishment
when he contemplates the infinite love of God for man! Not
satisfied with having undergone for our sake a most cruel death,
He penetrates the inmost recesses of the earth to transport into
bliss the souls whom He so dearly loved and whose liberation from
thence He had achieved.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part of this Article: &quot;The Third Day He
arose again from the Dead&quot;</h3>

<p>We now come to the second part of the Article, and how
indefatigable should be the labours of the pastor in its
exposition we learn from these words of the Apostle: Be mindful
that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead. This
command no doubt was addressed not only to Timothy, but to all
others who have care of souls.</p>

<p> The meaning of the Article is this: Christ the Lord expired
on the cross, on Friday at the ninth hour, and was buried on the
evening of the same day by His disciples, who with the permission
of the governor, Pilate, laid the body of the Lord, taken down
from the cross, in a new tomb, situated in a garden near at hand.
Early on the morning of the third day after His death, that is,
on Sunday, His soul was reunited to His body, and thus He who was
dead during those three days arose, and returned again to life,
from which He had departed when dying.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;He arose Again&quot;</h3>

<p>By the word Resurrection, however, we are not merely to
understand that Christ was raised from the dead, which happened
to many others, but that He rose by His own power and virtue, a
singular prerogative peculiar to Him alone. For it is
incompatible with nature and was never given to man to raise
himself by his own power, from death to life. This was reserved
for the almighty power of God, as we learn from these words of
the Apostle: Although he was crucified through weakness, yet he
liveth by the power of God. This divine power, having never been
separated, either from His body in the grave, or from His soul in
hell, there existed a divine force both within the body, by which
it could be again united to the soul, and within the soul, by
which it could again return to the body. Thus He was able by His
own power to return to life and rise from the dead.</p>

<p> This David, filled with the spirit of God, foretold in these
words: His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, and his arm
is holy. Our Lord confirmed this by the divine testimony of His
own mouth when He said: I lay down my life that I may take it
again . . . and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to
take it up again. To the Jews He also said, in corroboration of
His doctrine: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up. Although the Jews understood Him to have spoken thus of
that magnificent Temple built of stone, yet as the Scripture
testifies in the same place, he spoke of the temple of his body.
We sometimes, it is true, read in Scripture that He was raised by
the Father; but this refers to Him as man, just as those passages
on the other hand, which say that He rose by His own power relate
to Him as God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;From the Dead&quot;</h3>

<p>It is also the peculiar privilege of Christ to have been the
first who enjoyed this divine prerogative of rising from the
dead, for He is called in Scripture the firstÂ­begotten from the
dead, and also the firstÂ­born of the dead. The Apostle also
says: Christ is risen from the dead, the firstÂ­fruits of them
that sleep: for by a man came death, and by a man the
resurrection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in
Christ all shall be made alive. But every one in his own order:
the firstÂ­fruits Christ, then they that are of Christ.</p>

<p> These words of the Apostle are to be understood of a perfect
resurrection, by which we are raised to an immortal life and are
no longer subject to the necessity of dying. In this resurrection
Christ the Lord holds the first place; for if we speak of
resurrection; that is, of a return to life, subject to the
necessity of again dying, many were thus raised from the dead
before Christ, all of whom, however, were restored to life to die
again. But Christ the Lord, having subdued and conquered death,
so arose that He could die no morel according to' this most clear
testimony: Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more,
death shall no more have dominion over him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;The Third Day&quot;</h3>

<p>In explanation of the additional words of the Article, the
third day, the pastor should inform the people that they must not
think our Lord remained in the grave during the whole of these
three days. But as He lay in the sepulchre one full day, a part
of the preceding and a part of the following day, He is said,
with strictest truth, to have lain in the grave for three days,
and on the third day to have risen again from the dead.</p>

<p> To prove that He was God He did not delay His Resurrection to
the end of the world; while, on the other hand, to convince us
that He was truly man and really died, He rose not immediately,
but on the third day after His death, a space of time sufficient
to prove the reality of His death.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;According to the Scriptures&quot;</h3>

<p>Here the Fathers of the first Council of Constantinople added
the words, according to the Scriptures, which they took from St.
Paul. These words they embodied with the Creed, because the same
Apostle teaches the absolute necessity of the mystery of the
Resurrection when he says: If Christ be not risen again, then is
our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain . . . for you are
yet in your sins. Hence,, admiring our belief of this Article St.
Augustine says: It is no great thing to believe that Christ died.
This the pagans, Jews, and all the wicked believe; in a word, all
believe that Christ died. But that He rose from the dead is the
belief of the Christians. To believe that He rose again, this we
deem of great moment.</p>

<p> Hence it is that our Lord very frequently spoke to His
disciples of His Resurrection, and seldom or never of His Passion
without adverting to His Resurrection. Thus, when He said: The
son of man . . . shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be
mocked, and scourged, and spit upon; and after they have scourged
him, they will put him to death; He added: and the third day he
shall rise again.' Also when the Jews called upon Him to give an
attestation of the truth of His doctrine by some miraculous sign
He said: A sign shall not be given to them, but the sign of Jonas
the prophet. For as Jonas was in the whales belly three days and
three nights: so shall the son of man be in the heart of the
earth three days and three nights.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Three Useful Considerations on this Article</h3>

<p>To understand still better the force and meaning of this
Article, there are three things which we must consider and
understand: first, why the Resurrection was necessary; secondly,
its end and object; thirdly, the blessings and advantages of
which it is to us the source.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Necessity Of The Resurrection</h6>

<p> With regard to the first, it was necessary that Christ should
rise again in order to manifest the justice of God; for it was
most congruous that He who through obedience to God was degraded,
and loaded with ignominy, should by Him be exalted. This is a
reason assigned by the Apostle when he says to the Philippians:
He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the
death of the cross. For which cause God also hath exalted him. He
rose also to confirm our faith, which is necessary for
justification; for the Resurrection of Christ from the dead by
His own power affords an irrefragable proof that He was the Son
of God. Again the Resurrection nourishes and sustains our hope.
As Christ rose again, we rest on an assured hope that we too
shall rise again; the members must necessarily arrive at the
condition of their head. This is the conclusion which St. Paul
seems to draw when he writes to the Corinthians and to the
Thessalonians.' And Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, says:
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively
nope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto the
inheritance incorruptible.</p>

<p> Finally, the Resurrection of our Lord, as the pastor should
inculcate, was necessary to complete the mystery of our salvation
and redemption. By His death Christ liberated us from sin; by His
Resurrection, He restored to us the most important of those
privileges which we had forfeited by sin. Hence these words of
the Apostle: He was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for
our justification. That nothing, therefore, may be wanting to the
work of our salvation, it was necessary that as He died, He
should also rise again.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Ends Of The Resurrection</h6>

<p> From what has been said we can perceive what important
advantages the Resurrection of Christ the Lord has conferred on
the faithful. In the Resurrection we acknowledge God to be
immortal, full of glory, the conqueror of death and the devil;
and all this we are firmly to believe and openly to profess of
Christ Jesus. </p>

<p> Again, the Resurrection of Christ effects for us the
resurrection of our bodies not only because it was the efficient
cause of this mystery, but also because we all ought to arise
after the example of the Lord. For with regard to the
resurrection of the body we have this testimony of the Apostle:
By a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.
In all that God did to accomplish the mystery of our redemption
He made use of the humanity of Christ as an effective instrument,
and hence His Resurrection was, as it were, an instrument for the
accomplishment of our resurrection.</p>

<p> It may also be called the model of ours, inasmuch as His
Resurrection was the most perfect of all. And as His body, rising
to immortal glory, was changed, so shall our bodies also, before
frail and mortal, be restored and clothed with glory and
immortality. In the language of the Apostle: We look for the
Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, who will reform the body of our
lowness, made like to the body of his glory.</p>

<p> The same may be said of a soul dead in sin. How the
Resurrection of Christ is proposed to such a soul as the model of
her resurrection the same Apostle shows in these words: As Christ
is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may
walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in
the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of
his resurrection. Again a little further on he says: Knowing that
Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall
no more have dominion over him. For in that he died to sin, he
died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God: so do you
also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Advantages Of The: Resurrection</h6>

<p> From the Resurrection of Christ, therefore, we should draw
two lessons: the one, that after we have washed away the stains
of sin, we should begin to lead a new life, distinguished by
integrity, innocence, holiness, modesty, justice, beneficence and
humility; the other, that we should so persevere in that newness
of life as never more, with the divine assistance, to stray from
the paths of virtue on which we have once entered.</p>

<p> Nor do the words of the Apostle prove only that the
Resurrection of Christ is proposed as the model of our
resurrection; they also declare that it gives us power to rise
again, and imparts to us strength and courage to persevere in
holiness and righteousness, and in the observance of the
Commandments of God. For as His death not only furnishes us with
an example, but also supplies us with strength to die to sin, so
also His Resurrection invigorates us to attain righteousness, so
that thenceforward serving God in piety and holiness, we may walk
in the newness of life to which we have risen. By His
Resurrection, our Lord accomplished this especially that we, who
before died with Him to sin and to the world, should rise also
with Him to a new order and manner of life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Signs Of Spiritual Resurrection</h3>

<p>The principal signs of this resurrection from sin which should
be noted are taught us by the Apostle. For when he says: If you
be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, he distinctly tells
us that they who desire to possess life, honour, repose and
riches, there chiefly where Christ dwells, have truly risen with
Christ.</p>

<p> When he adds: Mind the things that are above, not the things
that are upon the earth, he gives, as it were, another sign by
which we may ascertain if we have truly risen with Christ. As a
relish for food usually indicates a healthy state of the body, so
with regard to the soul, if a person relishes whatever things are
true, whatever modest, whatever just, whatever holy, and
experiences within him the sweetness of heavenly things, this we
may consider a very strong proof that such a one has risen with
Christ Jesus to a new and spiritual life.</p>
