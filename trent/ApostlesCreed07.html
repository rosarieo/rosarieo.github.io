<h3><center>ARTICLE VII : &quot;FROM THENCE HE SHALL COME
TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD&quot;</center></h3>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning Of This Article</h3>

<p>For the glory and adornment of His Church Jesus Christ is
invested with three eminent offices and functions: those of
Redeemer, Mediator, and Judge. Since in the preceding Articles it
was shown that the human race was redeemed by His Passion and
death, and since by His Ascension into heaven it is manifest that
He has undertaken the perpetual advocacy and patronage of our
cause, it remains that in this Article we set forth His character
as Judge. The scope and intent of the Article is to declare that
on the last day Christ the Lord will judge the whole human race. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;From Thence He Shall Come&quot;</h3>

<p>The Sacred Scriptures inform us that there are two comings of
the Son of God: the one when He assumed human flesh for our
salvation in the womb of a virgin; the other when He shall come
at the end of the world to judge all mankind. This latter coming
is called in Scripture the day of the Lord. The day of the Lord,
says the Apostle, shall come, as a thief in the night; and our
Lord Himself says: Of that day and hour no one knoweth. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;To Judge the Living and the Dead&quot; </h3>

<p>In proof of the (last) judgment it is enough to adduce the
authority of the Apostle: We must all appear before the
judgment足seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper
things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good
or evil. There are numerous passages of Sacred Scripture which
the pastor will find in various places and which not only
establish the truth of the dogma, but also place it in vivid
colours before the eyes of the faithful. And if, from the
beginning of the world that day of the Lord, on which He was
clothed with our flesh, was sighed for by all as the foundation
of their hope of deliverance; so also, after the death and
Ascension of the Son of God, we should make that other day of the
Lord the object of our most earnest desires, looking for the
blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Two Judgments</h3>

<p>In explaining this subject the pastor should distinguish two
different occasions on which everyone must appear in the presence
of the Lord to render an account of all his thoughts, words and
actions, and to receive immediate sentence from his Judge.</p>

<p> The first takes place when each one of us departs this life;
for then he is instantly placed before the judgment足seat of God,
where all that he has ever done or spoken or thought during life
shall be subjected to the most rigid scrutiny. This is called the
particular judgment.</p>

<p> The second occurs when on the same day and in the same place
all men shall stand together before the tribunal of their Judge,
that in the presence and hearing of all human beings of all times
each may know his final doom and sentence. The announcement of
this judgment will constitute no small part of the pain and
punishment of the wicked; whereas the good and just will derive
great reward and consolation from the fact that it will then
appear what each one was in life. This is called the general
judgment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reasons For General Judgment</h3>

<p>It is necessary to show why, besides the particular judgment
of each individual, a general one should also be passed upon all
men.</p>

<p> Those who depart this life sometimes leave behind them
children who imitate their conduct, dependents, followers and
others who admire and advocate their example, language and
actions. Now by all these circumstances the rewards or
punishments of the dead must needs be increased, since the good
or bad influence of example, affecting as it does the conduct of
many, is to terminate only with the end of the world. Justice
demands that in order to form a proper estimate of all these good
or bad actions and words a thorough investigation should be made.
This, however, could not be without a general judgment of all
men.</p>

<p> Moreover, as the character of the virtuous frequently suffers
from misrepresentation, while that of the wicked obtains the
commendation of virtue, the justice of God demands that the
former recover, in the public assembly and judgment of all men,
the good name of which they had been unjustly deprived before
men.</p>

<p> Again, as the just and the wicked performed their good and
evil actions in this life not without the cooperation of the
body, it necessarily follows that these actions belong also to
the body as to their instrument. It was, therefore, altogether
suitable that the body should share with the soul the due rewards
of eternal glory or punishment. But this can only be accomplished
by means of a general resurrection and of a general judgment. </p>

<p> Next, it is important to prove that in prosperity and
adversity, which are sometimes the promiscuous lot of the good
and of the bad, everything is done and ordered by an all足wise
and all足just Providence. It was, therefore, necessary not only
that rewards should await the just and punishments the wicked, in
the life to come, but that they should be awarded by a public and
general judgment. Thus they will become better known and will be
rendered more conspicuous to all; and in atonement for the
unwarranted murmurings, to which on seeing the wicked abound in
wealth and flourish in honours even the Saints themselves, as
men, have sometimes given expression, a tribute of praise will be
offered by all to the justice and Providence of God. My feet,
says the Prophet, were almost moved, my steps had well nigh
slipped, because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing
the prosperity of sinners; and a little after: Behold! these are
sinners and yet abounding in the world, they have obtained
riches; and I said, Then have I in vain justified my heart, and
washed my hands among the innocent; and I have been scourged all
the day, and my chastisement hath been in the morning. This has
been the frequent complaint of many, and a general judgment is
therefore necessary, lest perhaps men may be tempted to say that
God walketh about the poles of heaven, and regards not the earth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>This Truth has Rightly been made an Article of the
Creed</h3>

<p>Wisely, therefore, has this truth been made one of the twelve
Articles of the Christian Creed, so that should any begin to
waver in mind concerning the Providence and justice of God they
might be reassured by this doctrine.</p>

<p> Besides, it was right that the just should be encouraged by
the hope, the wicked appalled by the terror, of a future
judgment; so that knowing the justice of God the former should
not be disheartened, while the latter through fear and
expectation of eternal punishment might be recalled from the
paths of vice. Hence, speaking of the last day, our Lord and
Saviour declares that a general judgment will one day take place,
and He describes the signs of its approach, that seeing them, we
may know that the end of the world is at hand. At His Ascension
also, to console His Apostles, overwhelmed with grief at His
departure, He sent Angels, who said to them: This Jesus who is
taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen
him going into heaven</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Circumstances of the Judgment:</h3>

<h3>The Judge</h3>

<p>That the judgment of the world has been assigned to Christ the
Lord, not only as God, but also as man, is declared in Scripture.
Although the power of judging is common to all the Persons of the
Blessed Trinity, yet it is specially attributed to the Son,
because to Him also in a special manner is ascribed wisdom. But
that as man, He will judge the world, is taught by our Lord
Himself when He says: As the Father hath life in himself, so he
hath given to the Son also, to have life in himself; and he hath
given him power to do judgment, because he is the son of man.</p>

<p> There is a peculiar propriety in Christ the Lord sitting in
judgment; for sentence is to be pronounced on mankind, and they
are thus enabled to see their Judge with their eyes and hear Him
with their ears, and so learn their judgment through the medium
of the senses. </p>

<p> Most just is it also that He who was most iniquitously
condemned by the judgment of men should Himself be afterwards
seen by all men sitting in judgment on all. Hence when the Prince
of the Apostles had expounded in the house of Cornelius the chief
dogmas of Christianity, and had taught that Christ was suspended
from a cross and put to death by the Jews and rose the third lay
to life, he added: And he commanded us to preach to the people,
and to testify that this is he, who was appointed of God, to be
the judge of the living and the dead.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Signs Of The General Judgment</h3>

<p>The Sacred Scriptures inform us that the general judgment will
be preceded by these three principal signs: the preaching of the
Gospel throughout the world, a falling away from the faith, and
the coming of Antichrist. This gospel of the kingdom, says our
Lord, shall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to
all nations, and then shall the consummation come. The Apostle
also admonishes us that we be not seduced by anyone, as if the
day of the Lord were at hand; for unless there come a revolt
first, and the man of sin be revealed, the judgement will not
come.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Sentence Of The Just</h3>

<p>The form and procedure of this judgment the pastor will easily
learn from the prophecies of Daniel, the writings of the
Evangelists and the doctrine of the Apostle. The sentence to be
pronounced by the judge is here deserving of more than ordinary
attention. </p>

<p> Looking with joyful countenance on the just standing on His
right, Christ our Redeemer will pronounce sentence on them with
the greatest benignity, in these words: Come ye blessed of my
Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning
of the world. That nothing can be conceived more delightful to
the ear than these words, we shall understand if we only compare
them with the condemnation of the wicked; and call to mind, that
by them the just are invited from labor to rest, from the vale of
tears to supreme joy, from misery to eternal happiness, the
reward of their works of charity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Sentence Of The Wicked</h3>

<p>Turning next to those who shall stand on His left, He will
pour out His justice upon them in these words: Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared f or the devil and his
angels. </p>

<p> The first words, depart from me, express the heaviest
punishment with which the wicked shall be visited, their eternal
banishment from the sight of God, unrelieved by one consolatory
hope of ever recovering so great a good. This punishment is
called by theologians the pain of loss, because in hell the
wicked shall be deprived forever of the light of the vision of
God.</p>

<p> The words ye cursed, which follow, increase unutterably their
wretched and calamitous condition. If when banished from the
divine presence they were deemed worthy to receive some
benediction, this would be to them a great source of consolation.
But since they can expect nothing of this kind as an alleviation
of their misery, the divine justice deservedly pursues them with
every species of malediction, once they have been banished.</p>

<p> The next words, into everlasting fire, express another sort
of punishment, which is called by theologians the pain of sense,
because, like lashes, stripes or other more severe chastisements,
among which fire, no doubt, produces the most intense pain, it is
felt through the organs of sense. When, moreover, we reflect that
this torment is to be eternal, we can see at once that the
punishment of the damned includes every kind of suffering.</p>

<p> The concluding words, which was prepared f or the devil and
his angels, make this still more clear. For since nature has so
provided that we feel miseries less when we have companions and
sharers in them who can, at least in some measure, assist us by
their advice and kindness, what must be the horrible state of the
damned who in such calamities can never separate themselves from
the companionship of most wicked demons ? And yet most justly
shall this very sentence be pronounced by our Lord and Saviour on
those sinners who neglected all the works of true mercy, who gave
neither food to the hungry, nor drink to the thirsty, who refused
shelter to the stranger and clothing to the naked, and who would
not visit the sick and the imprisoned.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance of Instruction on this Article</h3>

<p>These are thoughts which the pastor should very often bring to
the attention of his people; for the truth which is contained in
this Article will, if accepted with faithful dispositions, be
most powerful in bridling the evil inclinations of the heart and
in withdrawing men from sin. Hence we read in Ecclesiasticus: In
all thy works remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.'
And indeed there is scarcely anyone so given over to vice as not
to be recalled to virtue by the thought that he must one day
render an account before an all足just Judge, not only of all his
words and actions, but even of his most secret thoughts, and must
suffer punishment according to his deserts.</p>

<p> On the other hand, the just man will be more and more
encouraged to lead a good life. Even though his days be passed in
poverty, ignominy and suffering, he must be gladdened exceedingly
when he looks forward to that day when, the conflicts of this
wretched life being over, he shall be declared victorious in the
hearing of all men, and shall be admitted into his heavenly
country to be crowned with divine honours that shall never fade.</p>

<p> It only remains, then, for the pastor to exhort the faithful
to lead holy lives and practice every virtue, that thus they may
be enabled to look forward with confidence to the coming of that
great day of the Lord 足足 nay, as becomes children, even to
desire it most fervently.</p>
