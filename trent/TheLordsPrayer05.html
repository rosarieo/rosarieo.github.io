<h3><center>>THE FIFTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER:
&quot; AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS&quot;</center></h3>

<h3>The Importance Of Explaining This Petition</h3>

<p>So many are the things which display at once God's infinite
power and His equally infinite wisdom and goodness, that
wheresoever we turn our eyes or direct our thoughts, we meet with
the most certain signs of omnipotence and benignity. And yet
there is truly nothing that more eloquently proclaims His supreme
love and admirable charity towards us, than the inexplicable
mystery of the Passion of Jesus Christ, whence springs that
never­failing fountain to wash away the defilements of sin. (It
is this fountain) in which, under the guidance and bounty of God,
we desire to be merged and purified, when we beg of Him to
forgive us our debts. </p>

<p> This Petition contains a sort of summary of those benefits
with which the human race has been enriched through Jesus Christ.
This Isaias taught when he said: The iniquity of the house of
Jacob shall be forgiven; and this is all the fruit, that the sin
thereof should be taken away. David also shows this, proclaiming
those blessed who could partake of that salutary fruit: Blessed
are they whose iniquities are forgiven.</p>

<p> The pastor, therefore, should study and explain accurately
and diligently the meaning of this Petition, which, we perceive,
is so important to the attainment of salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Difference Between This And The Preceding Petitions </h3>

<p>In this Petition we enter on a new manner of praying. For
hitherto we asked of God not only eternal and spiritual goods,
but also transient and temporal advantages; whereas, we now ask
to be freed from the evils of the soul and of the body, of this
life and of the life to come.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dispositions with which this petition should be
Offered</h3>

<p>Since, however, to obtain what we ask we must pray in a
becoming manner, it appears expedient to explain the disposition
with which this prayer should be offered to God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Acknowledgment Of Sin</h3>

<p>The pastor, then, should admonish the faithful, that he who
comes to offer this Petition must first acknowledge, and next
feel sorrow and compunction for his sins. He must also be firmly
convinced that to sinners, thus disposed and prepared, God is
willing to grant pardon. This confidence is necessary to sinners,
lest perhaps the bitter remembrance and acknowledgment of their
sins should be followed by that despair of pardon, which of old
seized the mind of Cain and of Judas, both of whom looked on God
solely as an avenger and punisher, forgetting that He is also
mild and merciful. </p>

<p> In this Petition, therefore, we ought to be so disposed,
that, acknowledging our sins in the bitterness of our souls, we
may fly to God as to a Father, not as to a Judge, imploring Him
to deal with us not according to His justice, but according to
His mercy.</p>

<p> We shall be easily induced to acknowledge our sins if we
listen to God Himself admonishing us through the Sacred
Scriptures in this regard. Thus we read in David: They are all
gone aside; they are become unprofitable together; there is none
that doeth good, no not one. Solomon speaks to the same purpose:
There is no just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.
To this subject apply also these words: Who can say: &quot;my
heart is clean, I am pure from sin?&quot; The very same has been
written by St. John to deter men from arrogance: If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
Jeremias also says: Thou hast said: &quot;I am without sin, and
am innocent&quot;; and therefore, let thy anger be turned away
from me. Behold, I will contend with thee in judgment, because
thou hast said: &quot;I have not sinned.&quot;</p>

<p> Christ the Lord, who spoke by the mouth of all these,
confirms their teaching by this Petition in which He commands us
to confess our sins. The Council of Milevi forbids us to
interpret it otherwise. It hath pleased the Council, that
whosoever will have it that these words of the Lord's prayer,
&quot;forgive us our debts,&quot; are said by holy men in
humility, not in truth, let him be anathema. For who can endure a
person praying, and lying not to men, but to the Lord Himself,
saying with the lips that he desires to be forgiven, but with the
heart, that he has no debts to be forgiven ?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sorrow For Sin</h3>

<p>In making this necessary acknowledgment of our sins, it is Dot
enough to call them to mind lightly; for it is necessary that the
recollection of them be bitter, that it touch the heart, pierce
the soul, and imprint sorrow. Wherefore, the pastor should treat
this point diligently, that his pious hearers may not only
recollect their sins, and iniquities, but recollect them with
pain and sorrow; so that with true interior contrition they may
betake themselves to God their Father, humbly imploring Him to
pluck from the soul the piercing stings of sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Motives For Sorrow Over Sin: The Baseness Of Sin</h3>

<p>The pastor, however, should not be content with placing before
the eyes of the faithful the turpitude of sin. He should also
depict the unworthiness and baseness of men, who, though nothing
but rottenness and corruption, dare to outrage in a manner beyond
all belief the incomprehensible majesty and ineffable excellence
of God, particularly after having been created, redeemed and
enriched by Him with countless and invaluable benefits.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Consequences Of Sin</h3>

<p>And for what? Only for this, that separating ourselves from
God our Father, who is the supreme Good, and lured by the most
base rewards of sin, we may devote ourselves to the devil, to
become his most wretched slaves. Language is inadequate to depict
the cruel tyranny which the devil exercises over those who,
having shaken off the sweet yoke of God, and broken the most
lovely bond of charity by which our spirit is bound to God our
Father, have gone over to their relentless enemy, who is
therefore called in Scripture, the prince and ruler of the world,
the prince of darkness, and king over all the children of pride.
Truly to those who are oppressed by the tyranny of the devil
apply these words of Isaias: O Lord our God, other lords besides
thee have had dominion over us.</p>

<p> If these broken covenants of love do not move us, let at
least the calamities into which we fall by sin move us. The
sanctity of the soul is violated, which we know to have been
wedded to Christ. That temple of the Lord is profaned, against
the contaminators of which the Apostle utters this denunciation:
If any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy.</p>

<p> Innumerable are the evils brought upon man by sin, that
almost infinite pest of which David says: There is no health in
my flesh, because of thy wrath; there is no peace for my bones,
because of my sins. In these words he marks the violence of the
plague, confessing that it left no part of him uninfected by
pestiferous sin; for the poison had penetrated into his bones,
that is, it infected his understanding and will, which are the
two most intimate faculties of the soul. This widespread
pestilence the Sacred Scriptures point out, when they designate
sinners as the lame, the deaf, the dumb, the blind, the
paralysed.</p>

<p> But,­ besides the anguish which he felt on account of the
enormity of his sins, David was afflicted yet more by the
knowledge that he had provoked the wrath of God against him by
his sin. For the wicked are at war with God, who is offended
beyond belief at their crimes; hence the Apostle says: Wrath and
indignation, tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that
worketh evil. Although the sinful act is transient, yet the sin
by its guilt and stain remains; and the imminent wrath of God
pursues it, as the shadow does the body.</p>

<p> When, therefore, David was pierced by these tormenting
thoughts, he was moved to seek the pardon of his sins. That the
faithful, imitating the Prophet, may learn to grieve, that is, to
become truly penitent, and cherish the hope of pardon, the pastor
should call to their attention the example of David's penitential
sorrow, and the lessons of instruction drawn from his fiftieth
Psalm. </p>

<p> How great is the utility of this sort of instruction, which
teaches us to grieve for our sins, God Himself declares by the
mouth of Jeremias, who, when exhorting the Israelites to
repentance, admonished them to awake to a sense of the evils that
follow upon sin. See, he says, that it is an evil and a bitter
thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear
is not with thee, saith the Lord, the God of hosts. They who lack
this necessary sense of acknowledgment and grief, are said by the
Prophets Isaias, Ezechiel and Zachary to have a hard heart, a
stony heart, a heart of adamant, for, like stone, they are
softened by no sorrow, having no sense of life, that is, of the
salutary recognition (of their sinfulness).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Confidence In God's Mercy</h3>

<p>But lest the faithful, terrified by the grievousness of their
sins, despair of being able to obtain pardon, the pastor ought to
encourage them to hope by the following considerations. </p>

<p> As is declared in an Article of the Creed, Christ the Lord
has given power to the Church to remit sins.</p>

<p> Furthermore, in this Petition, our Lord has taught how great
is the goodness and bounty of God towards mankind; for if God
were not ready and prepared to pardon penitents their sins, never
would He have prescribed this formula of prayer: Forgive us our
trespass. Wherefore we ought to be firmly convinced, that since
He commands us in this Petition to implore His paternal mercy, He
will not fail to bestow it on us. For this Petition assuredly
implies that God is so disposed towards us, as willingly to
pardon those who are truly penitent.</p>

<p> God it is against whom, having cast off obedience, we sin;
the order of whose wisdom we disturb, as far as in us lies; whom
we offend; whom we outrage by words and deeds. But it is also
God, our most beneficent Father, who, having it in His power to
pardon all transgressions, has not only declared His willingness
to do so, but has also obliged men to ask Him for pardon, and has
taught in what words they are to do so. To no one, therefore, can
it be a matter of doubt, that under His guidance it is in our
power to be reconciled to God. And as this declaration of the
divine willingness to pardon increases faith, nurtures hope and
inflames charity, it will be worth while to amplify this subject,
by citing some Scriptural authorities and some examples of
penitents to whom God granted pardon of the most grievous crimes.
Since, however, in the introduction to the Lord's Prayer and in
that portion of the Creed which teaches the forgiveness of sins,
we were as diffuse on the subject as circumstances allowed, the
pastor will borrow from those places whatever may seem pertinent
for instruction on this point, for the rest drawing on the
fountains of the Sacred Scriptures.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Debts&quot;</h3>

<p>The pastor should also follow the same plan which we thought
should be used in the other Petitions. Let him explain, then,
what the word debts here signifies, lest perhaps the faithful,
deceived by its ambiguity, pray for something different from what
should be prayed for.</p>

<p> First, then, we are to know, that we by no means ask for
exemption from the debt we owe to God on so many accounts, the
payment of which is essential to salvation, namely, that of
loving Him with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole
mind; neither do we ask to be in future exempt from the duties of
obedience, worship, veneration, or any other similar obligation,
comprised also under the word debts.</p>

<p> What we do ask is that He may deliver us from sins. This is
the interpretation of St. Luke, who, instead of debts, makes use
of the word sins, because by their commission we become guilty
before God and incur a debt of punishment, which we must pay
either by satisfaction or by suffering. It was of this debt that
Christ the Lord spoke by the mouth of His Prophet: Then did I pay
that which I took not away. From these words of God we may
understand that we are not only debtors, but also unequal to the
payment of our debt, the sinner being of himself utterly
incapable of making satisfaction.</p>

<p> Wherefore we must fly to the mercy of God; and as justice, of
which God is most tenacious, is an equal and corresponding
attribute to mercy, we must make use of prayer, and the
intercession of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, without
which no one ever obtained the pardon of his sins, and from
which, as from its source, have flown all the efficacy and virtue
of satisfaction. For of such value is that price paid by Christ
the Lord on the cross, and communicated to us through the
Sacraments, received either actually or in purpose and desire,
that it obtains and accomplishes for us the pardon of our sins,
which is the object of our prayer in this Petition.</p>

<p> Here we ask pardon not only for our venial offences, for
which pardon may most easily be obtained, but also for grievous
and mortal sins. With regard to grave sins, however, this
Petition cannot procure forgiveness unless it derive that
efficacy from the Sacrament of Penance, received, as we have
already said, either actually or at least in desire.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Our&quot;</h3>

<p>The words our debts are used here in a sense entirely
different from that in which we said our bread. That bread is
ours, because it is given us by the munificence of God; whereas
sins are ours, because with us rests their guilt. They are our
voluntary acts, otherwise they would not have the character of
sin.</p>

<p> Admitting, therefore, and confessing the guilt of our sins,
we implore the clemency of God, which is necessary for their
expiation. In this we make use of no palliation whatever, nor do
we transfer the blame to others, as did our first parents Adam
and Eve. We judge ourselves, employing, if we are wise, the
prayer of the Prophet: Incline not my heart to evil words, to
make excuses in sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Forgive Us&quot;</h3>

<p>Nor do we say, forgive me, but forgive us; because the
fraternal relationship and charity which subsist between all men,
demand of each of us that, being solicitous for the salvation of
all our neighbours, we pray also for them while offering prayers
for ourselves.</p>

<p> This manner of praying, taught by Christ the Lord, and
subsequently received and always retained by the Church of God,
the Apostles most strictly observed themselves and taught others
to observe. </p>

<p> Of this ardent zeal and earnestness in praying for the
salvation of our neighbours, we have the splendid example of
Moses in the Old, and of St. Paul in the New Testament. The
former besought God thus: Either forgive them this trespass; or,
if thou dost not, strike me out of the book that thou hast
written; ' while the latter prayed after this manner: I wished
myself to be anathema from Christ for my brethren.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;As we Forgive our Debtors&quot;</h3>

<p>The word as may be understood in two senses. It may be taken
as having the force of a comparison, meaning that we beg of God
to pardon us our sins, just as we pardon the wrongs and
contumelies which we receive from those by whom we have been
injured. It may also be understood as denoting a condition, and
in this sense Christ the Lord interprets that formula. If, He
says, you forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you your offences; but if you will not forgive men,
neither will your Father forgive you your sins.</p>

<p> Either sense, however, equally contains the necessity of
forgiveness, intimating, as it does that, if we desire that God
should grant us the pardon of our offences, we ourselves must
pardon those from whom we have received injury; for so rigorously
does God exact from us forgetfulness of injuries and mutual
affection and love, that He rejects and despises the gifts and
sacrifices of those who are not reconciled to one another.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>Even the law of nature requires that we conduct ourselves
towards others as we would have them conduct themselves towards
us; hence he would be most impudent who would ask of God the
pardon of his own offences while he continued to cherish enmity
against his neighbour.</p>

<p> Those, therefore, on whom injuries have been inflicted,
should be ready and willing to pardon, urged to it as they are by
this form of prayer, and by the command of God in St. Luke: If
thy brother sin against thee, reprove him; and if he repent,
forgive him; and if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, &quot;I
repent,&quot; forgive him. In the Gospel of St. Matthew we read:
Love your enemies; and the Apostle, and before him Solomon wrote:
If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him
to drink; and finally we read in the Gospel of St. Mark: When you
shall stand to pray, forgive if you have anything against any
man; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your
sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reasons For Forgiveness</h3>

<p>But since, on account of the corruption of nature, there is
nothing to which man brings himself more reluctantly than to the
pardon of injuries, let pastors exert all the powers and
resources of their minds to change and bend the dispositions of
the faithful to this mildness and mercy so necessary to a
Christian. Let them dwell on those passages of Scripture in which
we hear God commanding to pardon enemies.</p>

<p> Let them also insist on this certain truth, that one of the
surest signs that men are children of God is their
willingness­to forgive injuries and sincerely love their
enemies; for in loving our enemies there shines forth in us some
likeness to God our Father, who, by the death of His Son,
ransomed from everlasting perdition and reconciled to Himself the
human race, which before was most unfriendly and hostile to Him.</p>

<p> Let the close of this exhortation and injunction be the
command of Christ the Lord, which, without utter disgrace and
ruin, we cannot refuse to obey: Pray for them that persecute and
calumniate you; that you may be the children of your Father who
is in heaven. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>This Petition Should Not be Neglected</h3>

<p>But in this matter no ordinary prudence is required on the
part of the pastor, lest, knowing the difficulty and necessity of
this precept, anyone despair of salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those Unable To Forget Injuries</h3>

<p>There are those who, aware that they ought to bury injuries in
voluntary oblivion and ought to love those that injure them,
desire to do so, and do so as far as they are able, but feel that
they cannot efface from their mind all recollection of injuries.
For there lurk in the mind some remains of private grudge, in
consequence of which such persons are disturbed by misgivings of
conscience, fearing that they have not in simplicity and
frankness laid aside their enmities and consequently do not obey
the command of God. </p>

<p> Here, therefore, the pastor should explain the contrary
desires of the flesh and of the spirit; that the former is prone
to revenge, the latter ready to pardon; that hence a continual
struggle and conflict goes on between them. Wherefore he should
point out that although the appetites of corrupt nature are ever
opposing and rebelling against reason, we are not on this account
to be uneasy regarding salvation, provided the spirit persevere
in the duty and disposition of forgiving injuries and of loving
our neighbour. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those Who Do Not Love Their Enemies</h3>

<p>There may be some who, because they have not yet been able to
bring themselves to forget injuries and to love their enemies,
are consequently deterred by the condition contained in this
Petition from making use of the Lord's Prayer. To remove from
their minds this pernicious error, the pastor should adduce the
two following considerations.</p>

<p> (In the first place), whoever belongs to the number of the
faithful, offers this prayer in the name of the entire Church, in
which there must necessarily be some pious persons who have
forgiven their debtors the debts here mentioned.</p>

<p> Secondly, when we ask this favour from God, we also ask for
whatever cooperation with the Petition is necessary on our part
in order to obtain the object of our prayer. Thus we ask the
pardon of our sins and the gift of true repentance; we pray for
the grace of inward sorrow; we beg that we may be able to abhor
our sins, and confess them truly and piously to the priest.
Since, then, it is necessary for us to forgive those who have
inflicted on us any loss or injury, when we ask pardon of God we
beg of Him at the same time to grant us grace to be reconciled to
those against whom we harbour hatred.</p>

<p> Those, therefore, who are troubled by that groundless and
perverse fear, that by this prayer they provoke still more the
wrath of God, should be undeceived and should be exhorted to make
frequent use of a prayer in which they beseech God our Father to
grant them the disposition to forgive those who have injured them
and to love their enemies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How to Make this Petition Fruitful</h3>

<h3>Penitential Dispositions</h3>

<p>But that this Petition may be really fruitful we should first
seriously reflect that we are suppliants before God, soliciting
from Him pardon, which is not granted but to the penitent; and
that we should, therefore, be animated by that charity and piety
which are fitting in penitents, whom it eminently becomes to keep
before their eyes, as it were, their own crimes and enormities
and to expiate them with tears.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Avoidance Of Dangers Of Sin</h3>

<p>To this thought should be joined caution in guarding for the
future against every occasion of sin, and against whatever I nay
expose us to the danger of offending God our Father. With this
solicitude the mind of David was occupied when he said: My sin is
always before me; and: Every night I will wash my bed; I will
water my couch with my tears.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Imitation Of Fervent Penitents</h3>

<p>Let each one also call to mind the ardent love of prayer of
those who obtained from God through their entreaties the pardon
of their sins. Such was the publican, who, standing afar off
through shame and grief, and with eyes fixed on the ground, only
smote his breast, crying: O God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
Such was also the woman, a sinner, who, standing behind Christ
the Lord, washed His feet, wiped them with her hair, and kissed
them. Lastly, there is the example of Peter, the Prince of the
Apostles, who going forth wept bitterly.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Frequent Use Of The Sacraments</h3>

<p>They should next consider that the weaker men are, and the
more liable to diseases of the soul, which are sins, the more
numerous and frequent are the remedies they need. Now the
remedies of a sick soul are Penance and the Eucharist; these,
therefore, the faithful should frequently make use of.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Almsdeeds</h3>

<p>Next almsdeeds, as the Sacred Scriptures declare, are a
medicine suited to heal the wounds of the soul. Wherefore, let
those who desire to make pious use of this prayer act kindly to
the poor according to their means. Of the great efficacy of alms
in effacing the stains of sin, the Angel of the Lord in Tobias,
holy Raphael, is a witness, who says: Alms deliver from death,
and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find
mercy and life everlasting. Daniel is another witness, who thus
admonished King Nabuchodonosor: Redeem thou thy sins with alms,
and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Spirit Of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>The best alms and the most excellent act of mercy is
forgetfulness of injuries, and good will towards those who have
injured us or ours, in person, in property, or in character.
Whoever, therefore, desires to experience in a special manner the
mercy of God, should make an offering to God Himself of all his
enmities, remit every offence, and pray for his enemies with the
greatest good will, seizing every opportunity of doing them good.
But as this subject was explained when we treated of murder, we
refer the pastor to that place.</p>

<p> The pastor ought to conclude his explanation of this Petition
with this final reflection, that nothing is, or can be conceived,
more unjust than that he who is so rigorous towards men as to
extend indulgence to no one, should himself demand that God be
mild and kind towards him.</p>
