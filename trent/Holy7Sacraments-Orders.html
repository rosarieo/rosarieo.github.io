<h3><center>THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS</center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Sacrament</h3>

<p>If one attentively considers the nature and essence of the
other Sacraments, it will readily be seen that they all depend on
the Sacrament of Orders to such an extent that without it some of
them could not be constituted or administered at all; while
others would be deprived of all their solemn ceremonies, as well
as of a certain part of the religious respect and exterior honour
accorded to them. Wherefore in continuing the exposition of the
doctrine of the Sacraments, it will be necessary for pastors to
bear in mind that it is their duty to explain with even special
care the Sacrament of Orders.</p>

<p> This explanation will be highly advantageous. First of all to
the pastor himself, then to all those who have entered on the
ecclesiastical state, and finally to the people in general. To
the pastor himself, because by treating of this subject he
himself will be more deeply moved to stir up within him the grace
he has received in this Sacrament; to those who have been called
to the portion of the Lord, partly by animating them with a like
spirit of piety, and partly by affording them an opportunity of
acquiring a knowledge of such things as will enable them all the
more easily to advance to higher orders; to the rest of the
faithful, first, because it enables them to understand the
respect due to the Church's ministers, and secondly, because as
it often happens that many may be present who have destined their
children, while yet young, for the Church's service, or who
desire to embrace that life themselves, it is far from right that
such persons should be unacquainted with the principal truths
regarding this particular state.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dignity of this Sacrament</h3>

<p>In the first place, then, the faithful should be shown how
great is the dignity and excellence of this Sacrament considered
in its highest degree, the priesthood.</p>

<p> Bishops and priests being, as they are, God's interpreters
and ambassadors, empowered in His name to teach mankind the
divine law and the rules of conduct, and holding, as they do, His
place on earth, it is evident that no nobler function than theirs
can be imagined. Justly, therefore, are they called not only
Angels, but even gods, because of the fact that they exercise in
our midst the power and prerogatives of the immortal God.</p>

<p> In all ages, priests have been held in the highest honour;
yet the priests of the New Testament far exceed all others. For
the power of consecrating and offering the body and blood of our
Lord and of forgiving sins, which has been conferred on them, not
only has nothing equal or like to it on earth, but even surpasses
human reason and understanding.</p>

<p> And as our Saviour was sent by His Father, and as the
Apostles and disciples were sent into the whole world by Christ
our Lord, so priests are daily sent with the same powers, for the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and the
edifying of the body of Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Requirements in Candidates for Orders</h3>

<h3>Holiness, Knowledge, Prudence</h3>

<p>The burden of this great office, therefore, should not be
rashly imposed on anyone, but is to be conferred on those only
who by their holiness of life, their knowledge, faith and
prudence, are able to bear it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Divine Call</h3>

<p>Let no one take the honour to himself, but he that is called
by God as Aaron was; and they are called by God who are</p>

<p> called by the lawful ministers of His Church. It is to those
who arrogantly intrude themselves into this ministry that the
Lord must be understood to refer when He says: I did not send
prophets, yet they ran. Nothing can be more unhappy and wretched
than such a class of men as this, and nothing more calamitous to
the Church of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Right Intention</h3>

<p>In every action we undertake it is of the highest importance
to have a good motive in view, for if the motive is good, the
rest proceeds harmoniously. The candidate for Holy Orders,
therefore, should first of all be admonished to entertain no
purpose unworthy of so exalted an office.</p>

<p> This subject demands all the greater attention, since in
these days the faithful often sin gravely in this respect. Some
there are who embrace this state to secure the necessaries of
life, and who, consequently, seek in the priesthood, just as
other men do in the lowest walks of life, nothing more or less
than gain. Though both the natural and divine law lay down, as
the Apostle remarks, that he who serves the altar should live by
the altar; yet to approach the altar for the sake of gain and
money is one of the very gravest of sacrileges.</p>

<p> Some are attracted to the priesthood by ambition and love of
honours; while there are others who desire to be ordained simply
in order that they may abound in riches, as is proved by the fact
that unless some wealthy benefice were conferred on them, they
would not dream of receiving Holy Orders. It is such as these
that our Saviour describes as hirelings, who, in the words of
Ezechiel, feed themselves and not the sheep, and whose baseness
and dishonesty have not only brought great disgrace on the
ecclesiastical state, so much so that hardly anything is now more
vile and contemptible in the eyes of the faithful, but also end
in this, that they derive no other fruit from their priesthood
than was derived by Judas from the Apostleship, which only
brought him everlasting destruction. </p>

<p> But they, on the other hand, who are lawfully called by God,
and who undertake the ecclesiastical state with the single motive
of promoting the honour of God, are truly said to enter the
Church by the door.</p>

<p> This, however, must not be understood as if the same law did
not bind all men equally. Men have been created to honour God,
and this the faithful in particular, who have obtained the grace
of Baptism, should do with their whole heart, their whole soul,
and with all their strength.</p>

<p> But those who desire to receive the Sacrament of Orders,
should aim not only at seeking the glory of God in all things­an
obligation admittedly common to all men, and particularly to the
faithful ­­ but also to serve Him in holiness and justice in
whatever sphere of His ministry they may be placed. Just as in
the army all the soldiers obey the general's orders, though they
all have not the same functions to discharge, one being a
centurion, another a prefect, so in like manner, though all the
faithful should diligently practice piety and innocence, which
are the chief means of honouring God, yet they who are in Holy
Otters have certain special duties and functions to discharge in
the Church. Thus they offer Sacrifice for themselves and for all
the people; they explain God's law and exhort and form the
faithful to observe it promptly and cheerfully; they administer
the Sacraments of Christ our Lord by means of which all grace is
conferred and increased; and, in a word, they are separated from
the rest of the people to fill by far the greatest and noblest of
all ministries.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Twofold Power Conferred by this Sacrament </h3>

<p>Having explained all this, the pastor should now turn his
attention to the special properties of this Sacrament, so that
the faithful who desire to enter into the ecclesiastical state
may understand the nature of the office to which they are called
and the extent of the power bestowed by God on the Church and her
ministers. </p>

<p> This power is twofold: the powers of orders and the power of
jurisdiction. The power of orders has for its object the real
body of Christ our Lord in the Blessed Eucharist. The power of
jurisdiction refers altogether to the mystical body of (Christ.
The scope of this power is to govern and rule the Christian
people, and lead them to the unending bliss of heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Power Of Orders</h3>

<p>The power of orders not only embraces the power of
consecrating the Eucharist, but also fits and prepares the souls
of men for its reception. It also embraces all else that can have
any reference to the Eucharist. Regarding this power numerous
passages of Sacred Scripture may be adduced; but the weightiest
and most striking are those which are read in St. John and St.
Matthew: As the Father, says our Lord, hath sent me I also send
you. .... Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive
they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain they are
retained; and: Amen, I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon
earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall
loose upon earth shall be loosed a also in heaven. These texts,
when expounded by pastors, in accordance with the teaching and
authority of the Fathers, will throw great light on this truth. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Greatness Of This Power</h3>

<p>This power far excels that given under the law of nature to
certain ones who had charge of sacred things. The period previous
to the written law must have had its priesthood and its spiritual
power, since it is certain that it had its law; for these two, as
the Apostle testifies, are so closely connected that if the
priesthood is transferred, the law must necessarily be
transferred also. Guided, therefore, by a natural instinct, men
recognised that God is to be worshipped; and hence it follows
that in every nation some, whose power might in a certain sense
be called spiritual, were given the care of sacred things and of
divine worship.</p>

<p> This power was also possessed by the Jews; but though it was
superior in dignity to that with which priests were invested
under the law of nature, yet it must be regarded as far inferior
to the spiritual power that is found in the New Law. For the
latter is heavenly, and surpasses all the power of Angels; it is
derived not from the Mosaic priesthood, but from Christ our Lord
who was a priest, not according to the order of Aaron, but
according to the order of Melchisedech. For He it is who, Himself
endowed with the supreme power of granting grace and remitting
sins, left to His Church this power, although He limited it in
extent and attached it to the Sacraments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Names of this Sacrament</h3>

<p>Hence to exercise this power certain ministers are appointed
and solemnly consecrated, which consecration is called the
Sacrament of Orders, or Sacred Ordination. The Fathers used this
word, which in itself has a most extensive signification, to show
the dignity and excellence of God's ministers.</p>

<p> In fact, order, when understood in its strict meaning and
acceptation, is the arrangement of superior and inferior things
so disposed as to stand in mutual relation towards each other.
Now as in this ministry there are many grades and various
functions, and as all these are disposed and arranged according
to a definite plan, the name Order has been well and properly
applied to it. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Holy Orders Is a Sacrament</h3>

<p>That Sacred Ordination is to be numbered among the Sacraments
of the Church, the Council of Trent has established by the same
line of reasoning as we have already used several times. Since a
Sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing, and since the outward
action in this consecration denotes the grace and power bestowed
on him who is consecrated, it becomes clearly evident that Order
must be truly and properly regarded as a Sacrament. Thus the
Bishop, handing to him who is being ordained a chalice with wine
and water, and a paten with bread, says: Receive the power of
offering sacrifice, etc. In these words, pronounced along with
the application of the matter, the Church has always taught that
the power of consecrating the Eucharist is conferred, and that a
character is impressed on the soul which brings with it grace
necessary for the due and proper discharge of that office, as the
Apostle declares thus: I admonish thee that thou stir up the
grace of God which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands; for
God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of
love, and of sobriety. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Number of Orders</h3>

<p>Now, to use the words of the holy Council: The ministry of so
sublime a priesthood being a thing all divine, it is but
befitting its worthier and more reverent exercise that in the
Church's well-ordered disposition there should be several
different orders of ministers destined to assist the priesthood
by virtue of their office, ­­ orders arranged in such a way
that those who have already received clerical tonsure should be
raised, step by step, from the lower to the higher orders.</p>

<p> It should be taught, therefore, that these orders are seven
in number, and that this has been the constant teaching of the
Catholic Church. These orders are those of porter, lector,
exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon and priest.</p>

<p> That the number of ministers was wisely established thus may
be proved by considering the various offices that are necessary
for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the
consecration and administration of the Blessed Eucharist, this
being the principal scope of their institution.</p>

<p> They are divided into major or sacred, and minor orders. The
major or sacred orders are priesthood, deaconship and
subdeaconship; while the minor orders are those of acolyte,
exorcist, lector and porter, concerning each of which we shall
now say a few words so that the pastor may be able to explain
them to those especially whom he knows to be about to receive any
of the orders in question. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Tonsure</h3>

<p>In the beginning should be explained first tonsure, and it
should be shown that this is a sort of preparation for the
reception of orders. As men are prepared for Baptism by exorcisms
and for Matrimony by engagement, so to those who dedicate
themselves to God by tonsure the way is opened that leads to the
Sacrament of Orders; for by the cutting off of hair is signified
the character and disposition of him who desires to devote
himself to the sacred ministry.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Name &quot;Cleric&quot;</h3>

<p>Regarding the name cleric, which is then given him for the
first time, it is derived from the fact that he thereby begins to
take the Lord for his lot and inheritance, just as those, who
among the Jews were attached to the service of God, were
forbidden by the Lord to have any part of the ground that would
be distributed in the land of promise: , he said, am thy portion
and inheritance. And although these words are true of all the
faithful, yet it is certain that they apply in a special way to
those who consecrate themselves to the service of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Origin And Meaning Of Tonsure</h3>

<p>The hair of the head is cut off in the form of a crown. It
should be always worn thus, and should be enlarged according as
one is advanced to higher orders.</p>

<p> The Church teaches that this usage is derived from Apostolic
origin, as mention is made of it by the most ancient and
authoritative Fathers, such as St. Denis the Areopagite, St.
Augustine and St. Jerome.</p>

<p> It is said that the Prince of the Apostles first introduced
this usage in memory of the crown of thorns which was put upon
our Saviour's head, so that the devices resorted to by the
impious for the ignominy and torture of Christ might be used by
His Apostles a sign of honour and glory, as well as to signify
that the ministers of the Church should strive to resemble Christ
our Lord and represent Him in all things.</p>

<p> Some, however, assert that by tonsure is denoted the royal
dignity, that is, the portion reserved especially for those who
are called to the inheritance of the Lord. It will readily be
seen that what the Apostle Peter says of all the faithful: You
are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation,
applies especially and with much greater reason to the ministers
of the Church.</p>

<p> Still there are some who consider that by the circle, which
is the most perfect of all figures, is signified the profession
of a more perfect life undertaken by ecclesiastics; while in view
of the fact that the hair of their heads, which is a kind of
bodily superfluity, is cut off, others think that it denotes
contempt for external things, and detachment of soul from all
human cares. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Minor Orders</h3>

<h3>Porter</h3>

<p>After tonsure it is customary to advance to the first order,
which is that of porter. The function (of porter) is to guard the
keys and doors of the church, and to allow no one to enter there
to whom access has been forbidden. Formerly the porter used to
assist at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, to see that no one
approached too near the altar, or disturbed the priest during the
celebration of the divine mysteries. Other duties were also
assigned to him, as may be seen from the ceremonies used at his
ordination.</p>

<p> Thus the Bishop, taking the keys from the altar, hands them
to him who is being made porter, and says: Let your conduct be
that of one who has to render to God an account of those things
that are kept under these keys.</p>

<p> How great was the dignity of this order in the ancient Church
may be inferred from a usage which exists in the Church in these
times. For the office of treasurer, which is still numbered among
the more honourable functions of the Church, was entrusted to
porters, and carried with it also the guardianship of the
sacristy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reader</h3>

<p>The second degree of orders is the office of reader, whose
duty it is to read in the church in a clear and distinct voice
the books of the Old and of the New Testament, and especially
those which are read during the nocturnal psalmody. Formerly it
was also his duty to teach the faithful the first rudiments of
the Christian religion.</p>

<p> Hence it is that when ordaining him, the Bishop, in the
presence of the people, handing him a book in which are set down
all that regards this office, says: Take, and be you an announcer
of the word of God; if you faithfully and profitably discharge
your office, you shall have a part with those who from the be­
ginning have well ministered the word of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Exorcist</h3>

<p>The third order is that of exorcists, to whom is given the
power to invoke the name of the Lord over those who are possessed
by unclean spirits. Hence the Bishop when ordaining them presents
to them a book in which the exorcisms are contained, and at the
same time pronounces this form of words: Take, and commit to
memory, and have the power of imposing hands over the possessed,
whether baptised or catechumen.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Acolyte</h3>

<p>The fourth degree is that of acolytes, and it is the last of
the orders that are called minor and not sacred. Their duty is to
attend and serve the ministers who are in major orders, that is,
the deacon and subdeacon, in the Sacrifice of the altar. They
also carry and attend to the lights during the celebration of the
Sacrifice of the Mass, and especially during the reading of the
Gospel, from which fact they are also called candle­bearers. </p>

<p> Therefore at the ordination of acolytes the Bishop observes
the following rite: First of all he carefully warns them of the
nature of their office; then hands to each of them a light,
saying: Receive this candlestick and candle, and remember that
henceforth you are given the charge of lighting the candles of
the church, in the name of the Lord. Then he hands them empty
cruets in which are presented the wine and water for the
Sacrifice, saying: Receive these cruets to supply wine and water
for t) c Eucharist of Christ's blood, in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Major Orders</h3>

<h3>Subdeacon</h3>

<p>From the minor orders, which are not sacred, and of which we
have been speaking until now, one lawfully enters and ascends to
major and Sacred Orders.</p>

<p> Now the subdiaconate is the first degree of (major orders).
Its function, as the name itself indicates, is to serve the
deacon at the altar. It is the subdeacon who should prepare the
altar linen, the vessels and the bread and wine necessary for the
celebration of the Holy Sacrifice. He also it is who presents
water to the Bishop or priest when he washes his hands during the
Sacrifice of the Mass. It is also the subdeacon who now reads the
Epistle which in former times was read at Mass by the deacon. He
assists as witness at the Holy Sacrifice, and guards the
celebrant from being disturbed by anyone during the sacred
ceremonies.</p>

<p> The various duties that pertain to the subdeacon are
indicated by the solemn ceremonies used at his ordination. In the
first place the Bishop warns him that the obligation of perpetual
continence is attached to this order, and declares that no one is
to be admitted among the subdeacons who is not ready and willing
to accept the obligation in question. Then, after the solemn
recitation of the Litanies, the Bishop enumerates and explains
the duties and functions of the subdeacon. Thereupon each one of
those who are being ordained receives the chalice and sacred
paten from the Bishop; and, to show that he is to serve the
deacon, the subdeacon receives from the archdeacon cruets filled
with wine and water, together with a basin and towel with which
to wash and dry the hands. At the same time the Bishop pronounces
these words: See what sort of ministry is entrusted to you; I
admonish you therefore, to show yourself worthy to please God.
Other prayers follow, and finally, when the Bishop has clothed
the subdeacon with the sacred vestments, for each of which there
are special words and ceremonies, he gives kiln the book of the
Epistles, saying: Receive the book of the Epistles with power to
read them in the Holy Church of God, as well for the living as
for the dead.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Deacon</h3>

<p>The second degree of Sacred Orders is that of the deacons,
whose functions are much more extensive and have always been
regarded as more holy. His duty it is to be always at the side of
the Bishop, guard him while he preaches, serve him and the priest
during the celebration of the divine mysteries, as well as during
the administration of the Sacraments, and to read the Gospel in
the Sacrifice of the Mass. In former times he frequently warned
the faithful to be attentive to the holy mysteries; he
administered our Lord's blood in those churches in which the
custom existed that the faithful should receive the Eucharist
under both species; and to him was entrusted the distribution of
the Church's goods, as well as the duty of providing for all that
was necessary to each one's sustenance. To the deacon also, as
the eye of the Bishop, it belongs to see who they are in the city
a that lead a good and holy life, and who not; who are present at
the Holy Sacrifice and sermons at appointed times, and who not;
so that he may be able to give an account of all to the Bishop,
and enable him to admonish and advise each one privately, or to
rebuke and correct publicly, according as he may deem more
profitable. He should also read out the list of the catechumens
and present to the Bishop those who are to be admitted to orders.
Finally in the absence of a Bishop or priest, he can explain the
Gospel, but not from the pulpit, thus letting it be seen that
this is not his proper office.</p>

<p> The Apostle shows the great care that should be taken that no
one unworthy of the diaconate be promoted to this order, when in
his Epistle to Timothy he sets forth a deacon's character,
virtues and integrity. The same point is also gathered from the
rites and solemn ceremonies which the Bishop employs when
ordaining him. The Bishop uses more numerous and more solemn
prayers at the ordination of a deacon than at that of a
subdeacon, and he also adds other kinds of sacred vestments.
Moreover, he imposes hands on him, just as we read the Apostles
used to do when ordaining the first deacons. Finally, he hands
him the book of the Gospels, with these words: Receive the power
to read the Gospel in the Church of God both for the living and
the dead in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Priest</h3>

<p>The third and highest degree of all Sacred Orders is the
priesthood. The Fathers of the first centuries usually designated
those who had received this order by two names. At one time they
called them presbyters ­­ a Greek word signifying elders, not
only because of the ripe years very necessary for this order, but
much more on account of their gravity, knowledge and prudence;
for it is written: Venerable old age is not that of long time nor
counted by the number of years; but the understanding of a man is
grey hairs and an unspotted life is old age. At other times they
call them priests, both because they are consecrated to God, and
because to them it belongs to administer the Sacraments and take
charge of things sacred and divine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Twofold Priesthood</h3>

<p>But as Sacred Scripture describes a twofold priesthood, one
internal and the other external, it will be necessary to have a
distinct idea of each to enable pastors to explain the nature of
the priesthood now under discussion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Internal Priesthood</h3>

<p>Regarding the internal priesthood, all the faithful are said
to be priests, once they have been washed in the saving waters of
Baptism. Especially is this name given to the just who have the
Spirit of God, and who, by the help of divine grace, have been
made living members of the great High­priest, Jesus Christ; for,
enlightened by faith which is inflamed by charity, they offer tip
spiritual sacrifices to God on the altar of their hearts. Among
such sacrifices must be reckoned every good and virtuous action
done for the glory of God.</p>

<p> Hence we read in the Apocalypse: Christ hath washed us front
our sins. in his own blood and hath made us a kingdom, and
priests to God and his Father. In like manner was it said by the
Prince of the Apostles: Be you also as living stones built up, a
spiritual house a holy priesthood offering up spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; while the Apostle
exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice holy ,
pleasing unto God your reasonable service. And long before this
David had said: A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a
contrite and humble heart O God thou wilt not despise. All this
clearly regards the internal priesthood. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The External Priesthood</h3>

<p>The external priesthood, on the contrary, does not pertain to
the faithful at large, but only to certain men who have been
ordained and consecrated to God by the lawful imposition of hands
and by the solemn ceremonies of holy Church, and who are thereby
devoted to a particular sacred ministry.</p>

<p> This distinction of the priesthood can be seen even in the
Old Law. That David spoke of the internal priesthood, we have
just shown. On the other hand, everyone knows the many and
various precepts given by the Lord to Moses and Aaron regarding
the external priesthood. Along with this He appointed the whole
tribe of Levi to the ministry of the Temple, and He forbade by
law that anyone belonging to another tribe should dare to intrude
himself into that function. Hence it was that King Ozias was
afflicted with leprosy by the Lord for having usurped the
sacerdotal ministry, and had to suffer grave chastisements for
his arrogance and sacrilege. </p>

<p> Now as the same distinction (of a twofold) priesthood may be
noted in the New Law, the faithful should be cautioned that what
we are now about to say concerns that external priesthood which
is conferred on certain special individuals. This alone belongs
to the Sacrament of Holy Orders.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Functions of the Priesthood</h3>

<p>The office of a priest, then, is to offer Sacrifice to God and
to administer the Sacraments of the Church. This is proved by the
very ceremonies used at his ordination. When­ordaining a priest,
the Bishop first of all imposes hands on him, as do all the other
priests who are present. Then he puts a stole on his shoulders
and arranges it over his breast in the form of a cross, declaring
thereby that the priest is clothed with power from on high,
enabling him to carry the cross of Christ our Lord and the sweet
yoke of God's law, and to inculcate this law not only by words,
but also by the example of a most holy and virtuous life.</p>

<p> He next anoints his hands with holy oil, and then gives him
the chalice with wine and the paten with a host, saying at the
same time: Receive the power to offer Sacrifice to God and to
celebrate Masses both for the living and for the dead. By these
words and ceremonies the priest is constituted an interpreter and
mediator between God and man, which indeed must be regarded as
the principal function of the priesthood.</p>

<p> Lastly, placing his hands a second time on the head (of the
person ordained the Bishop) says: Receive the Holy Ghost; whose
sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose sins you
shall retain they are retained, thus communicating to him that
divine power of forgiving and retaining sin which was given by
our Lord to His disciples. Such, then, are the special and
principal functions of the sacerdotal order.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Degrees of the Priesthood</h3>

<h3>Priests</h3>

<p>Now although (the sacerdotal order) is one alone, yet it has
various degrees of dignity and power. The first degree is that of
those who are simply called priests, and of whose functions we
have hitherto been speaking.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Bishops</h3>

<p>The second is that of Bishops, who are placed over the various
dioceses to govern not only the other ministers of the Church,
but the faithful also, and to promote their salvation with
supreme vigilance and care. Hence it is that in Sacred Scripture
they are often called pastors of the sheep. Their office and duty
has been well described by St. Paul in his sermon to the
Ephesians, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles; while St.
Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, has also laid down a divine
rule for the exercise of the episcopal office. And if Bishops
strive to conform their actions according to this rule, there can
be no doubt that they will be good pastors and will be also
esteemed as such. Bishops are also called pontiffs. This name is
derived from the pagans, who thus designated their chief priests.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Archbishops</h3>

<p>The third degree is that of Archbishops, who preside over a
number of Bishops and who are called Metropolitans, because they
are Bishops of those cities which are regarded as the metropolis
of their respective provinces. Hence they enjoy greater dignity
and more extensive power than Bishops, although their Ordination
is the same.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Patriarchs</h3>

<p>In the fourth degree come Patriarchs, that is to say, the
first and highest of the Fathers. Formerly, besides the Roman
Pontiff, there were in the universal Church only four Patriarchs,
who, however, were not of equal dignity. Thus Constantinople,
though it reached the patriarchal honour only after all the
others, yet it obtained a higher rank by reason of being the
capital of the Empire. Next in rank came the Patriarch of
Alexandria, which Church had been founded by St. Mark the
Evangelist by order of the Prince of the Apostles. The third was
that of Antioch, where Peter fixed his first See. Finally, that
of Jerusalem, a See first governed by James, the brother of our
Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Pope</h3>

<p>Above all these, the Catholic Church has always placed the
Supreme Pontiff of Rome, whom Cyril of Alexandria, in the Council
of Ephesus, named the Chief Bishop, Father and Patriarch of the
whole world. He sits in that chair of Peter in which beyond every
shadow of doubt the Prince of the Apostles sat to the end of his
days, and hence it is that in him the Church recognises the
highest degree of dignity, and a universality of jurisdiction
derived, not from the decrees of men or Councils, but from God
Himself. Wherefore he is the Father and guide of all the
faithful, of all the Bishops, and of all the prelates, no matter
how high their power and office; and as successor of St. Peter,
as true and lawful Vicar of Christ our Lord, he governs the
universal Church.</p>

<p> From what has been said, therefore, pastors should teach what
are the principal duties and functions of the various
ecclesiastical orders and degrees, and also who is the minister
of this Sacrament. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Minister of Holy Orders</h3>

<p>Beyond all doubt, it is to the Bishop that the administration
(of orders) belongs, as is easily proved by the authority of Holy
Scripture, by most certain tradition, by the testimony of all the
Fathers, by the decrees of the Councils, and by the usage and
practice of Holy Church.</p>

<p> It is true that permission has been granted to some abbots
occasionally to administer those orders that are minor and not
sacred; yet there is no doubt whatever that it is the proper
office of the Bishop, and of the Bishop alone to confer the
orders called holy or major.</p>

<p> To ordain subdeacons, deacons and priests, one Bishop
suffices; but in accordance with an Apostolic tradition that has
been always observed in the Church, Bishops are consecrated by
three Bishops. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Recipient of Holy Orders</h3>

<p>We now come to indicate who are fit to receive this Sacrament,
and especially the priestly order, and what are the principal
dispositions required of them.</p>

<p> From (what we shall lay down concerning the dispositions
requisite for the priesthood) it will be easy to determine what
ought to be observed in conferring the other orders, due account
being taken of the office and dignity of each. Now the extreme
caution I hat should be used in conferring this Sacrament is
gathered from the fact that, while all the other Sacraments
impart grace to the recipient for his own use and sanctification,
he, on the other hand, who receives Holy Orders is made partaker
of heavenly grace precisely that by his ministry he may promote
the welfare of the Church and therefore of all mankind.</p>

<p> Hence we readily understand why it is that ordinations take
place only on special days, on which, moreover, in accordance
with a very ancient practice of the Catholic Church, a solemn
fast is appointed in order that by holy and fervent prayer the
faithful may obtain from God ministers who will be well qualified
to exercise properly and to the advantage of the Church the power
of so great a ministry.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Qualifications for the Priesthood</h3>

<h3>Holiness Of Life</h3>

<p>The chief and most necessary quality requisite in him who is
to be ordained a priest is that he be recommended by integrity of
life and morals: first because, by procuring or permitting his
ordination while conscious of mortal sin, a man renders himself
guilty of a new and enormous crime; and secondly, because the
priest is bound to give to others the example of a holy and
innocent life.</p>

<p> In this connection pastors should set forth the rules which
the Apostle laid down to Titus and Timothy, and he should also
explain that those bodily defects, which, by the Lord's command
excluded from the service of the altar in the Old Law, should for
the most part be understood of deformities of soul in the New
Law. This is why the holy custom has been established in the
Church that he who is about to be admitted to orders should first
take great care to cleanse his conscience in the Sacrament of
Penance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Competent Knowledge</h3>

<p>In the second place there is required of the priest not only
that knowledge which concerns the use and administration of the
Sacraments; but he should also be versed in the science of Sacred
Scripture, so as to be able to instruct the people in the
mysteries of the Christian faith and the precepts of the divine
law, lead them to piety and virtue, and reclaim them from sin. </p>

<p> The priest's duties are twofold. The first is to consecrate
and administer the Sacraments properly; the second is to instruct
the people entrusted to him in all that they must know or do in
order to be saved. Hence the words of the Prophet Malachias: The
lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the
Law at his mouth; because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts. </p>

<p> Now to fulfil the first of these duties it is enough for him
to be endowed with a moderate share of knowledge. As for the
second, it is no mere ordinary, but very special knowledge that
is required. At the same time, however, it should be remembered
that a profound knowledge of abstruse questions is not demanded
of all priests in an equal degree. It is enough that each one
knows all that is necessary for the discharge of his office and
ministry.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Canonical Fitness</h3>

<p>This Sacrament should not be conferred on children, nor on the
insane or mad, because they are devoid of the use of reason. Yet
if it does happen to be administered to them, we must
unhesitatingly believe that the sacramental character becomes
impressed on their souls. As for the precise age requisite for
the reception of the various orders, this will easily be found in
the decrees of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p> Slaves also are excluded. He who is not his own master and
who is in the power of another, should not be dedicated to the
divine service.</p>

<p> Homicides and men of blood are also rejected, because they
are excluded by a law of the Church and are declared irregular. </p>

<p> The same must be said of the illegitimate and of all those
not born in lawful wedlock. It is only right that those who are
dedicated to the divine service should have nothing in them which
could expose them to the well­deserved derision or contempt of
others.</p>

<p> Finally, those who are notably maimed or deformed should not
be admitted. A defect or deformity of this kind cannot but offend
the eye and stand in the way of the due administration of the
Sacraments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Effects of Holy Orders</h3>

<p>This much being explained, it now remains for pastors to point
out the effects of this Sacrament. It is evident that the
Sacrament of Orders, while mainly concerned, as already
explained, with the welfare and beauty of the Church,
nevertheless also confers on the soul of him who is ordained the
grace of sanctification, fitting and qualifying him for the
proper discharge of his functions and for the administration of
the Sacraments, in the same way as by the grace of Baptism each
one is qualified to receive the other Sacraments.</p>

<p> Another grace is clearly conferred by this Sacrament; namely,
a special power with reference to the most Blessed Sacrament of
the Eucharist. This power is full and perfect in the priest,
because he alone can consecrate the body and blood of our Lord;
but it is greater or less in the inferior ministers in proportion
as their ministry approaches the Sacrament of the Altar.</p>

<p> This power is also called a spiritual character, because
those who have been ordained are distinguished from the rest of
the faithful by a certain interior mark impressed on the soul, by
which they are dedicated to the divine worship. It is this grace
which the Apostle seems to have had in view when he said to
Timothy: Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given
thee by prophecy, with imposition of hands of the priesthood; and
again: I admonish thee, that thou stir up the grace of God which
is in thee by the imposition of my hands.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Admonition</h3>

<p>This much will suffice for the Sacrament of Orders. We have
aimed at presenting nothing more than the principal points that
bear on the subject, so as to supply the pastor with sufficient
matter for instructing the faithful, and directing them to
Christian piety.</p>
