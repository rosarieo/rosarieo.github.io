<h3><center>THE SIXTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER:
&quot; <i>AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION</i>.&quot;</center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Petition</h3>

<p>When the children of God, having obtained the pardon of their
sins, are inflamed with the desire of giving to God worship and
veneration; when they long for the kingdom of heaven; when they
engage in the performance of all the duties of piety towards the
Deity, relying entirely on His paternal will and providence, нн
then it is that the enemy of mankind employs the more actively
all his artifices, and prepares all his resources to attack them
so violently as to justify the fear that, wavering and altered in
their sentiments, they may relapse into sin, and thus become far
worse than they had been before. To such as these may justly be
applied the saying of the Prince of the Apostles: It had been
better for them not to have known the way of justice, than, after
they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which
was delivered to them.</p>

<p> Hence Christ the Lord has commanded us to offer this Petition
so that we may commend ourselves daily to God, and implore His
paternal care and assistance, being assured that, if we be
deserted by the divine protection, we shall soon fall into the
snares of our most crafty enemy.</p>

<p> Nor is it in the Lord's Prayer alone that He has commanded us
to beg of God not to suffer us to be led into temptation. In His
address to the holy Apostles also, on the very eve of His death,
after He had declared them clean, He admonished them of this duty
in these words: Pray that ye enter not into temptation. </p>

<p> This admonition, reiterated by Christ the Lord, imposes on
the pastor the weighty obligation of exciting the faithful to a
frequent use of this prayer, so that, beset as men constantly are
by the great dangers which the devil prepares, they may ever ad
dress to God, who alone can repel those dangers, the prayer, Lead
us not into temptation.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity of the Sixth Petition</h3>

<h3>Human Frailty</h3>

<p>The faithful will understand how very much they stand in need
of this divine assistance, if they remember their own weakness
and ignorance, if they recollect this saying of Christ the Lord:
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak; if they call
to mind how grievous and destructive are the misfortunes of men
brought on through the instigation of the devil, unless they be
upheld and assisted by the right hand of the Most High. </p>

<p> What more striking example can there be of human infirmity,
than the holy band of the Apostles, who, though they had just
before felt very courageous, at the first sight of danger,
abandoned the Saviour and fled. A still more conspicuous example
is the conduct of the Prince of the Apostles. He who a short time
before loudly protested his courage and special loyalty to Christ
the Lord, he who had been so confident in himself as to say,
Though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee, became so
affrighted at the voice of a poor maidнservant that he declared
at once with an oath that he knew not the Lord. Doubtless his
courage was not equal to his goodнwill. But if, by the frailty
of human nature in which they confided, even the Saints have
sinned grievously, what have not others to fear, who are so far
below them in holiness?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Assaults Of The Flesh</h3>

<p>Wherefore, let the pastor remind the faithful of the conflicts
and dangers in which we are continually engaged, as long as the
soul is in this mortal body, assailed as we are on all sides by
the world, the flesh and the devil.</p>

<p> How few are there who are not compelled to experience at
their great cost what anger, what concupiscence can do in us? Who
is not annoyed by these stings? who does not feel these goads?
who does not burn with these smouldering fires? And, indeed, so
various are these assaults, so diversified these attacks, that it
is extremely difficult not to receive some grievous wound. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Temptations Of The Devil</h3>

<p>And besides these enemies that dwell and live with us, there
are, moreover, those most bitter foes, of whom it is written: Our
wrestling is not against, flesh and blood; but against
principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world' of
this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high
places. For to our inward conflicts are added the external
assaults and attacks of the demons, who both assail us openly,
and also insinuate themselves by stratagem into our souls, so
much so that it is only with great difficulty that we can escape
them.</p>

<p> The Apostle entitles the demons princes, on account of the
excellence of their nature, since by nature they are superior to
man, and to all other visible creatures. He also calls them
powers, because they excel not only by their nature, but also by
their power. He designates them rulers of the world of darkness,
because they rule not the world of light and glory, that is to
say, the good and the pious, but the world of gloom and darkness,
namely, those who, blinded by the defilement and darkness of a
wicked life, are satisfied to have for their leader the devil,
the prince of darkness. He also terms the demons the spirits of
wickedness, because there is a wickedness of the spirit, as well
as of the flesh. What is called the wickedness of the flesh
inflames the appetite to lusts and pleasures, which are perceived
by the senses; while the wickedness of the spirit are evil
purposes and depraved desires, which belong to the superior part
of the soul, and which are so much worse than the wickedness of
the flesh as mind itself and reason are higher and more excellent
(than the senses). The wickedness of Satan the Apostle spoke of
as in the high places, because the chief aim of the evil one is
to deprive us of our heavenly inheritance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Audacity Of The Demons</h3>

<p>From all this we may understand that the power of these
enemies is great, their courage undaunted, their hatred of us
enormous and unmeasured; that they also wage against us a
perpetual war, so that with them there can be no peace, no truce.
</p>

<p> How great is their audacity is evidenced by the words of
Satan, recorded by the Prophet: I will ascend into heaven. He
attacked our first parents in Paradise; he assailed the Prophets;
he beset the Apostles in order, as the Lord says in the Gospel,
that he might sift them as wheat.' Nor was he abashed even by the
presence of Christ the Lord Himself. His insatiable desire and
unwearied diligence St. Peter therefore expressed when he said:
Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion goeth about, seeking
whom he may devour.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Number Of The Demons</h3>

<p>But it is not Satan alone that tempts men, for sometimes a
host of demons combine to attack an individual. This that evil
spirit confessed, who, having been asked his name by Christ the
Lord, replied, My name is legion; that is to say, a multitude of
demons, tormented their unhappy victim. And of another demon it
is written: He taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Malignity And Power Of The Demons</h3>

<p>There are many who, because they do not feel the assaults of
demons against them, imagine that the whole matter is fictitious;
nor is it surprising that such persons are not attacked by
demons, to whom they have voluntarily surrendered themselves.
They possess neither piety nor charity, nor any virtue worthy of
a Christian; hence they are entirely in the power of the devil,
and there is no need of any temptation to overcome them, since
their souls have already become his willing abode. </p>

<p> But those who have dedicated themselves to God, leading a
heavenly life upon earth, are the chief objects of the assaults
of Satan. Against them he harbours bitterest hatred, laying
snares for them each moment. Sacred Scripture is full of examples
of holy men who, in spite of their firmness and resolution, were
perverted by his violence or fraud. Adam, David, Solomon and
others, whom it would be tedious to enumerate, experienced the
violent and crafty cunning of demons, which neither human
prudence nor human strength can overcome.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Protects Man's Weakness Against The Enemies Of
His Soul</h3>

<p>Who, then, can deem himself sufficiently secure in his own
resources? Hence the necessity of offering to God pure and pious
prayer, that He suffer us not to be tempted above our strength,
but make issue with temptation, that we may be able to bear it.</p>

<p> But should any of the faithful, through weakness or
ignorance, feel terrified at the power of the demons, they are to
be encouraged, when tossed by the waves of temptation, to take
refuge in this harbour of prayer. For however great the power and
pertinacity of Satan, he cannot, in his deadly hatred of our
race, tempt or torment us as much, or as long as he pleases; but
all his power is governed by the control and permission of God.
The example of Job is very well known. Satan could have touched
nothing belonging to him, if God had not said to the devil:
Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; while on the other hand,
had not the Lord added: Only put not forth thy hand upon his
person, Job with his children and possessions, would have been at
once destroyed by the devil. So restricted is the power of
demons, that without the permission of God, they could not even
enter into the swine mentioned by the Evangelists.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Temptation&quot;</h3>

<p>To understand the meaning of this Petition, it is necessary to
say what temptation signifies here, and also what it is to be led
into temptation.</p>

<p> To tempt is to sound a person in order that by eliciting from
him what we desire, we may extract the truth. This mode of
tempting does not apply to God; for what is there that God does
not know? All things are naked and open to his eyes.</p>

<p> Another kind of tempting implies more than this? inasmuch as
it may have either a good or a bad purpose. Temptation has a good
purpose, when someone's worth is tried, in order that when it has
been tested and proved he may be rewarded and honoured, his
example proposed to others for imitation, and all may be incited
thereby to the praises of God. This is the only kind of tempting
that can be found in God. Of it there is an example in
Deuteronomy: The Lord your God tries you, that it may appear
whether you love him or not.</p>

<p> In this manner God is also said to tempt His own, when He
visits them with want, disease and other sorts of calamities.
This He does to try their patience, and to make them an example
of Christian virtue. Thus we read that Abraham was tempted to
immolate his son, by which fact he became a singular example of
obedience and patience to all succeeding times. Thus also is it
written of Tobias: Because thou wast acceptable to God, it was
necessary that temptation should prove thee.</p>

<p> Men are tempted for a bad purpose, when they are impelled to
sin or destruction. To do this is the work of the devil, for he
tempts men with a view to deceive and precipitate them into ruin,
and he is therefore called in Scripture, the tempter At one time,
stimulating us from within, he employs the agency of the
affections and passions of the soul. At another time, assailing
us from without, he makes use of external things, as of
prosperity, to puff us up with pride, or of adversity, to break
our spirits. Sometimes he has for his emissaries and assistants
abandoned men, particularly heretics, who, sitting in the chair
of pestilence, scatter the deadly seeds of bad doctrines, thus
unsettling and precipitating headlong those persons who draw no
line of distinction between vice and virtue and are of themselves
prone to evil.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Lead us not into Temptation&quot;</h3>

<p>We are said to be led into temptation when we yield to
temptations. Now this happens in two ways. First, we are led into
temptation when, yielding to suggestion, we rush into that evil
to which some one tempts us. No one is thus led into temptation
by God; for to no one is God the author of sin, nay, He hates all
who work iniquity; and accordingly we also read in St. James: Let
no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted of God; for
God is not a tempter of evils.</p>

<p> Secondly, we are said to be led into temptation by him who,
although he himself does not tempt us nor cooperate in tempting
us, yet is said to tempt because he does not prevent us from
being tempted or from being overcome by temptations when he is
able to prevent these things. In this manner God, indeed, suffers
the good and the pious to be tempted, but does not leave them
unsupported by His grace. Sometimes, however, we fall, being left
to ourselves by the just and secret judgment of God, in
punishment of our sins. </p>

<p> God is also said to lead us into temptation when we abuse, to
our destruction, His blessings, which He has given us as a means
of salvation; when, like the prodigal son, we squander our
Father's substance, living riotously and yielding to our evil
desires. In such a case we can say what the Apostle has said of
the law: The commandment that was ordained to life, the same was
found to be unto death to me.</p>

<p> Of this an opportune example is Jerusalem, as we learn from
Ezechiel. God had so enriched that city with every sort of
embellishment, that He said of it by the mouth of the Prophet:
Thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee.
Yet Jerusalem, favoured with such an abundance of divine gifts,
was so far from showing gratitude to God, from whom she had
received and was still receiving so many favours, was so far from
making use of those heavenly gifts for the attainment of her own
happiness, the end for which she had received them, that having
cast away the hope and idea of deriving spiritual profit from
them, she, most ungrateful to God her Father, was content to
enjoy her present abundance with a luxury and riotousness which
Ezechiel describes at considerable length in the same chapter.
Wherefore those whom God permits to convert into instruments of
vice the abundant opportunities of virtuous deeds which He has
afforded them, are equally ungrateful to Him.</p>

<p> But we ought carefully to notice a certain usage of Sacred
Scripture, which sometimes denotes the permission of God in words
which, if taken literally, would imply a positive act on the part
of God. Thus in Exodus we read: I will harden the heart of
Pharoah; and in Isaias: Blind the heart of this people; and the
Apostle to the Romans writes: God delivered them up to shameful
affections, and to a reprobate sense. In these and other similar
passages we are to understand, not at all any positive act on the
part of God, but His permission only.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Objects of the Sixth Petition</h3>

<h3>What We Do Not Pray For</h3>

<p>These observations having been premised, it will not be
difficult to understand the object for which we pray in this
Petition.</p>

<p> We do not ask to be totally exempt from temptation, for human
life is one continued temptation. This, however, is useful and
advantageous to man. Temptation teaches us to know ourselves,
that is, our own weakness, and to humble ourselves under the
powerful hand of God; and by fighting manfully, we expect to
receive a neverнfading crown of glory. For he that striveth for
the mastery is not crowned, except he strive lawfully. Blessed is
the man, says St. James, that endureth temptation; for when he
hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which God
hath promised to them that love him. If we are sometimes hard
pressed by the temptation of the enemy, it will also cheer us to
reflect, that we have a high priest to help us, who can have
compassion on our infirmities, having been tempted himself in all
things.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What We Pray For In This Petition</h3>

<p>What, then, do we pray for in this Petition ? We pray that the
divine assistance may not forsake us, lest having been deceived,
or worsted, we should yield to temptation; and that the grace of
God may be at hand to succour us when our strength fails, to
refresh and invigorate us in our trials.</p>

<p> We should, therefore, implore the divine assistance, in
general, against all temptations, and especially when assailed by
any particular temptation. This we find to have been the conduct
of David, under almost every species of temptation. Against
lying, he prays in these words: Take not thou the word of truth
utterly out of my mouth; against covetousness: Incline my heart
unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness; and against the
vanities of this life and the allurements of concupiscence, he
prays thus: Turn away my eyes, that they may not behold vanity.</p>

<p> We pray, therefore, that we yield not to evil desires, and be
not wearied in enduring temptation; that we deviate not from the
way of the Lord; that in adversity, as in prosperity, we preserve
equanimity and fortitude; and that God may never deprive us of
His protection. Finally, we pray that God may crush Satan beneath
our feet.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dispositions which should Accompany this Petition </h3>

<p>The pastor ought next to admonish the faithful concerning the
chief thoughts and reflections that should accompany this prayer </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Distrust Of Self And Confidence In God</h3>

<p>It will, then, be found most efficacious, when offering this
Petition that, remembering our weakness, we distrust our own
strength; and that, placing all our hopes of safety in the divine
goodness and relying on the divine protection, we encounter the
greatest dangers with undaunted courage, calling to mind
particularly the many persons, animated with such hope and
resolution, who were delivered by God from the very jaws of
Satan.</p>

<p> When Joseph was assailed by the criminal solicitations of a
wicked woman, did not God rescue him from the imminent danger,
and exalt him to the highest degree of glory? Did He not preserve
Susanna, when beset by the ministers of Satan, and on the point
of being made the victim of an iniquitous sentence? Nor is this
surprising; for her heart, says the Scripture, trusted in the
Lord. How exalted the praise, how great the glory of Job, who
triumphed over the world, the flesh and the devil ! There are on
record many similar examples to which the pastor should refer, in
order to exhort with earnestness his pious hearers to this hope
and confidence. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Remembrance Of The Victory Of Christ And His Saints</h3>

<p>The faithful should also reflect who is their leader against
the temptations of the enemy; namely, Christ the Lord, who was
victorious in the same combat. He overcame the devil; He is that
stronger man who, coming upon the strong armed man, overcame him,
deprived him of his arms, and stripped him of his spoils. Of
Christ's victory over the world, we read in St. John: Have
confidence: I have overcome the world; and in the Apocalypse, He
is called the conquering lion; and it is. said of Him that He
went forth conquering that He might conquer, because by His
victory He has given power to others to conquer.'</p>

<p> The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews abounds with the
victories of holy men, who by faith conquered kingdoms, stopped
the mouths of lions, etc. While we read of such achievements, we
should also take into account the victories which are every day
won by men eminent for faith, hope and charity, in their interior
and exterior conflicts with the demons, нн victories so
numerous and so signal, that, were we spectators of them, we
should deem no event of more frequent occurrence, none of more
glorious issue. It was with reference to such defeats of the
enemies that St. John wrote: I write unto you, young men, because
you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have
overcome the wicked one.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Watchfulness</h3>

<p>Satan, however, is overcome not by indolence, sleep, wine,
revelling, or lust; but by prayer, labor, watching, fasting,
continence and chastity. Watch ye and pray, that ye enter not
into temptation, as we have already said, is the admonition of
our Lord. They who make use of these weapons in the conflict put
the enemy to flight; for the devil flees from those who resist
him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Author of victory over Temptation</h3>

<p>But from the consideration of these victories achieved by holy
men which we have mentioned, let no one indulge feelings of
selfнcomplacency, nor flatter himself that, by his own single
unassisted exertions, he is able to withstand the temptations and
hostile assaults of the demons. This is not within the power of
human nature, nor within the capacity of human frailty.</p>

<p> The strength by which we lay prostrate the satellites of
Satan comes from God, who maketh our arms as a bow of brass; by
whose aid the bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are
girt with strength; who giveth us the protection of salvation,
whose right hand upholdeth us: who teacheth our hands to war, and
our fingers to battle. Hence to God alone must thanks be given
for victory, since it is only through His guidance and help that
we are able to conquer. This the Apostle did; for he said: Thanks
to God, who hath given us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ. The voice from heaven, mentioned in the Apocalypse, also
proclaims God to be the author of our victories: Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
power of his Christ; because the accuser of our brethren is cast
forth; and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&quot; The
same book declares that the victory obtained over the world and
the flesh belongs to Christ the Lord, when it says: They shall
fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. But enough
has now been said on the cause and the manner of conquering
(temptation). </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Rewards of Victories over temptation</h3>

<p>When these things have been explained, the pastor should
instruct the faithful concerning the crowns prepared by God, and
the eternal and superabundant rewards reserved for those who
conquer. He should quote from the Apocalypse the following divine
promises: He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second
death; and in another place: He that shall overcome, shall thus
be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name
out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my
Father, and before his angels. A little after, our divine Lord
Himself thus addresses John: He that shall overcome, I will make
him a pillar in the temple of my God: and he shall go out no
more: and again: To him that shall overcome, I win give to sit
with me in my throne; as I also have overcome, and am set down
with my Father in his throne. Finally, having unveiled the glory
of the Saints, and the never ending bliss which they shall enjoy
in heaven, He adds, He that shall overcome shall possess these
things.</p>
