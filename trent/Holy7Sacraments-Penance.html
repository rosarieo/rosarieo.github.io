<h3>THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE </h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Sacrament</h3>

<p>As the frailty and weakness of human nature are universally
known and felt by each one in himself, no one can be ignorant of
the great necessity of the Sacrament of Penance. If, thereÂ­
fore, the diligence of pastors should be proportioned to the
weight and importance of the subject, we must admit that in
expounding this Sacrament they can never be sufficiently
diligent. Nay, it should be explained with more care than
Baptism. Baptism is administered but once, and cannot be
repeated; Penance may be administered and becomes necessary, as
often as we may have sinned after Baptism. Hence the Council of
Trent declares: For those who fall into sin after Baptism the
Sacrament of Penance is as necessary to salvation as is Baptism
for those who have not been already baptised. The saying of St.
Jerome that Penance is a second plank, is universally known and
highly commended by all subsequent writers on sacred things. As
he who suffers shipwreck has no hope of safety, unless,
perchance, he seize on some plank from the wreck, so he that
suffers the shipwreck of baptismal innocence, unless he cling to
the saving plank of Penance, has doubtless lost all hope of
salvation. </p>

<p>These instructions are intended not only for the benefit of
pastors, but also for that of the faithful at large, to awaken
attention, lest they be found culpably negligent in a matter so
very important. Impressed with a just sense of the frailty of
human nature, their first and most earnest desire should be to
advance with the divine assistance in the ways of God, without
sin or failing. But should they at any time prove so unfortunate
as to fall, then, looking at the infinite goodness of God, who
like the good shepherd binds up and heals the wounds of His
sheep, they should not postpone recourse to the most saving
remedy of Penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Different Meanings of the Word
&quot;Penance&quot; </h3>

<p>To enter at once on the subject, and to avoid all error to
which the ambiguity of the word may give rise, its different
meanings are first to be explained. By penance some understand
satisfaction; while others, who wander far from the doctrine of
the Catholic faith, supposing penance to have no reference to the
past, define it to be nothing more than newness of life. It must,
therefore, be shown that the word has a variety of meanings. </p>

<p>In the first place, it is said of those to whom that which was
before pleasing is now displeasing, whether the object itself was
good or bad. In this sense all those repent whose sorrow is
according to the world, not according to God; and therefore,
worketh not salvation, but death. </p>

<p>In the second place, it is used to express that sorrow which
the sinner conceives, not, however, for the sake of God, but for
his own sake, concerning some sin of his in which he once took
pleasure. </p>

<p>A third kind of penance is that by which we experience
interior sorrow of heart, or give exterior indication of such
sorrow for the sake of God alone. To all these kinds of sorrow
the word repentance properly applies. </p>

<p>When the Sacred Scriptures say that God repented, the
expression is evidently figurative. When we repent of any thing,
we are most anxious to change it; and hence when God has resolved
to change any thing, the Scriptures, accommodating their language
to our manner of speaking, say that He repents. Thus we read that
it repented him that he had made man, and also that He was sorry
that He had made Saul king. </p>

<p>But an important distinction is to be made between these
different significations of the word. The first kind of penance
must be considered faulty; the second is only the agitation of a
disturbed mind; the third we call both a virtue and a Sacrament.
In this last sense penance is taken here. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Virtue of Penance</h3>

<p>We shall first treat of penance as a virtue, not only because
it is the duty of the pastor to lead the faithful to the practice
of every virtue; but also, because the acts which proceed from
penance as a virtue, constitute the matter, as it were, of
Penance as a Sacrament, and unless the virtue be rightly
understood, the force of the Sacrament cannot be appreciated. </p>

<p>The faithful, therefore, are first to be admonished and
exhorted to labor strenuously to attain this interior penance of
the heart which we call a virtue, and without which exterior
penance can avail them very little. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Meaning Of Penance</h3>

<p>Interior penance consists in turning to God sincerely and from
heart, and in hating and detesting our past transgressions, with
a firm resolution of amendment of life, hoping to obtain pardon
through the mercy. Accompanying this penance, like inseparable
companion of detestation for sin, is a sorrow and sadness, which
is a certain agitation and disturbance of the soul, and is called
by many a passion. Hence many of the Fathers define penance as an
anguish of soul. </p>

<p>Penance, however, in those who repent, must be preceded by
faith, for without faith no man can turn to God. Faith,
therefore, cannot on any account be called a part of penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Penance Proved To Be A Virtue</h3>

<p>That this inward penance is, as we have already said, a
virtue, the various commands which have been given regarding it
clearly show; for the law commands only those actions that are
virtuous. </p>

<p>Furthermore, no one can deny that it is a virtue to be
sorrowful at the time, in the manner, and to the extent which are
required. To regulate sorrow in this manner belongs to the virtue
of penance. Some conceive a sorrow which bears no proportion to
their crimes. Nay, there are some, says Solomon, who are glad
when they have done evil. Others, on the contrary, give
themselves to such melancholy and grief, as utterly to abandon
all hope of salvation. Such, perhaps, was the condition of Cain
when he exclaimed: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve
pardon. Such certainly was the condition of Judas, who,
repenting, hanged himself, and thus lost soul and body. Penance,
therefore, considered as a virtue, assists us in restraining
within the bounds of moderation our sense of sorrow. </p>

<p>That penance is a virtue may also be inferred from the ends
which the true penitent proposes to himself. The first is to
destroy sin and efface from the soul its every spot and stain.
The second is to make satisfaction to God for the sins which he
has committed, which is clearly an act of justice. Between God
and man, it is true, no relation of strict justice can exist, so
great is the distance that separates them; yet between them there
is evidently a sort of justice, such as exists between a father
and his children, between a master and his servants. The third
(end of the penitent) is to reinstate himself in the favour and
friendship of God whom he has offended and whose hatred he has
earned by the turpitude of sin. The foregoing considerations
sufficiently prove that penance is a virtue. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Steps Which Lead Up To This Virtue</h3>

<p>We must also point out the steps by which we may ascend to
this divine virtue. I The mercy of God first goes before us and
converts our hearts to Him. This was the object of the Prophet's
prayer: Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted. </p>

<p>Illumined by this light the soul next tends to God by faith.
He that cometh to God, says the Apostle, must believe that he is,
and is a rewarder of them that seek him. </p>

<p>A salutary fear of God's judgments follows, and the soul,
contemplating the punishments that await sin, is recalled from
the paths of vice. To this (state of soul) seem to refer these
words of Isaias: As a woman with child, when she draweth near the
time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs, so
are we become. </p>

<p>Then follows a hope of obtaining mercy from God, encouraged by
which we resolve on improvement of life. </p>

<p>Lastly, our hearts are inflamed by charity, whence springs
that filial fear which good and dutiful children experience; and
thus dreading only to offend the majesty of God in anything, we
entirely abandon the ways of sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Fruits Of This Virtue</h3>

<p>Such are, as it were, the steps by which we ascend to this
most exalted virtue, a virtue altogether heavenly and divine, to
which the Sacred Scriptures promise the kingdom of heaven; for it
is written in St. Matthew: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand. If, says Ezechiel, the wicked do penance for all his
sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and
do judgment and justice, living he shall live. In another place:
I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn
from his way and live, words which are evidently understood of
eternal life. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Penance as a Sacrament</h3>

<p>Regarding external penance it will be necessary to show that
in it the Sacrament properly consists, and that it possesses
certain outward and sensible signs which denote the effect that
takes place interiorly in the soul. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Why Christ Instituted This Sacrament</h3>

<p>In the first place, however, it will be well to explain why it
is that Christ our Lord was pleased to number Penance among the
Sacraments. One of His reasons certainly was to leave us no room
for doubt regarding the remission of sin which was promised by
God when He said: If the wicked do penance, etc. For each one has
good reason to distrust the accuracy of his own judgment on his
own actions, and hence we could not but be very much in doubt
regarding the truth of our internal penance. It was to destroy
this, our uneasiness, that our Lord instituted the Sacrament of
Penance, by means of which we are assured that our sins are
pardoned by the absolution of the priest; and also to tranquilize
our conscience by means of the trust we rightly repose in the
virtue of the Sacraments. The words of the priest sacramentally
and lawfully absolving us from our sins are to be accepted in the
same sense as the words of Christ our Lord when He said to the
paralytic: Son, be of good heart: thy sins are forgiven thee. </p>

<p>In the second place, no one can obtain salvation unless
through Christ and the merits of His Passion. Hence it was
becoming in itself, and highly advantageous to us, that a
Sacrament should be instituted through the force and efficacy of
which the blood of Christ flows into our souls, washesÂ­
awayÂ­all the sins committed after Baptism, and thus leads us to
recognise that it is to our Saviour alone we owe the blessing of
reconciliation. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Penance Is a Sacrament</h3>

<p>That Penance is a Sacrament pastors can easily show from what
follows. As Baptism is a Sacrament because it blots out all sins,
and especially original sin, so for the same reason Penance,
which takes away all the sins of thought and deed committed after
Baptism, must be regarded as a true Sacrament in the proper sense
of the word. </p>

<p>Moreover Â­Â­ and this is the principal reason Â­Â­ since what
is exteriorly done, both by priest and penitent, signifies the
inward effects that take place in the soul, who will venture to
deny that Penance is invested with the nature of a proper and
true Sacrament ? For a Sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing. Now
the sinner who repents plainly expresses by his words and actions
that he has turned his heart from sin; while from the words and
actions of the priest we easily recognise the mercy of God
exercised in the remission of sins. </p>

<p>In any event, the words of our Saviour furnish a clear proof:
I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever
thou shalt loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven. The
absolution announced in the words of the priest expresses the
remission of sins which it accomplishes in the soul. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>This Sacrament May Be Repeated</h3>

<p>The faithful should be instructed not only that Penance is to
be numbered among the Sacraments, but that it is one of the
Sacraments which may be repeated. To Peter, who had asked whether
pardon could be given to sin seven times, our Lord replied: I say
not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven. </p>

<p>If, then, (the pastor) happens to encounter those who seem to
distrust the infinite goodness and clemency of God, let him
endeavour to inspire their minds with confidence, and raise them
up to the hope of obtaining the grace of God. He will easily
accomplish this object by explaining the above and other passages
which are frequently met with in Holy Writ; as well as by using
the arguments and reasons which may be found in St. Chrysostom's
book On the Lapsed, and St. Ambrose's books On Penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Constituent Parts of Penance</h3>

<h3>The Matter</h3>

<p>There is nothing that should be better known to the faithful
than the matter of this Sacrament; hence they should be taught
that Penance differs from the other Sacraments in this that while
the matter of the other Sacraments is some thing, whether natural
or artificial, the matter, as it were, of the Sacrament of
Penance is the acts of the penitent, Â­Â­ namely, contrition,
confession and satisfaction, Â­Â­ as has been declared by the
council of Trent. Now, inasmuch as these acts are by divine
institution required on the part of the penitent for the
integrity of the Sacrament, and for the full and perfect
remission of sin, they are called parts of Penance. It is not
because they are not the real matter that they are called by the
Council the matter as it were, but because they are not of that
sort of matter which is applied externally, such, for instance,
as water in Baptism and chrism in Confirmation. </p>

<p>As regards the opinion of some who hold that sins themselves
are the matter of this Sacrament, it will be found, when
carefully examined, that it does not really differ from the
explanation already given. Thus we say that wood which is
consumed by fire is the matter of fire. In the same way, sins
which are destroyed by Penance may properly be called the matter
of Penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Form Of Penance</h3>

<p>Pastors should not neglect to explain the form of the
Sacrament of Penance. A knowledge of it will excite the faithful
to receive the grace of this Sacrament with the greatest possible
devotion. Now the form is: I absolve thee, as may be inferred not
only from the words, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall
be bound also in heaven, but also from the teaching of Christ our
Lord, handed down to us by the Apostles. </p>

<p>Moreover, since the Sacraments signify what they effect, the
words, I absolve thee, signify that remission of sin is effected
by the administration of this Sacrament; and hence it is plain
that such is the perfect form of the Sacrament. For sins are, so
to say, the chains by which the soul is bound, and from which it
is freed by the Sacrament of Penance. And none the less truly
does the priest pronounce the form over the penitent who, through
perfect contrition, accompanied by the desire of confession, has
already obtained remission of his sins from God. </p>

<p>Several prayers are added, not that they are necessary to the
form, but in order to remove every obstacle that can impede the
force and efficacy of the Sacrament owing to the fault of him to
whom it is administered. </p>

<p>How thankful, then, should not sinners be to God for having
bestowed such ample power on the priests of His Church ! Unlike
the priests of the Old Law who merely declared the leper cleansed
from his leprosy, the power now given to the priests of the New
Law is not limited to declaring the sinner absolved from his
sins, but, as a minister of God, he truly absolves from sin. This
is an effect of which God Himself, the author and source of grace
and justice, is the principal cause. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Rites Observed in the Sacrament of Penance
</h3>

<p>The faithful should take great care to observe the rites which
accompany the administration o f this Sacrament. In this way they
will have a higher idea of what they obtain from this Sacrament,
that is, that they have been reconciled as slaves to their kind
master, or rather, as children to their best of fathers; and at
the same time they will also better understand what is the duty
of those who desire, as everyone should, to show their gratitude
and remembrance of so great a benefit. </p>

<p>The sinner, then, who repents, casts himself humbly and
sorrowfully at the feet of the priest, in order that by there
humbling himself he may the more easily be led to see that he
must tear up the roots of pride whence spring and flourish all
the sins he now deplores. In the priest, who is his legitimate
judge, he venerates the person and the power of Christ our Lord;
for in the administration of the Sacrament of Penance, as in that
of the other Sacraments, the priest holds the place of Christ.
Next the penitent enumerates his sins, acknowledging, at the same
time, that he deserves the greatest and severest chastisements;
and finally, suppliantly asks pardon for his faults. </p>

<p>All these rites have a sure guarantee for their antiquity in
the authority of St. Denis. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Effects of the Sacrament of Penance</h3>

<p>Nothing will prove of greater advantage to the faithful,
nothing will be found to conduce more to a willing reception of
the Sacrament of Penance, than for pastors to explain frequently
the great advantage to be derived therefrom. They will then see
that of Penance it is truly said that its roots ale bitter, but
its fruit sweet indeed. </p>

<p>First of all, then, the great efficacy o Penance consists in
this, that it restores us to the grace of God, and unites us to
Him in the closest friendship. </p>

<p>In pious souls who approach this Sacrament with devotion,
profound peace and tranquillity of conscience, together with
ineffable joy of soul, accompany this reconciliation. For there
is no sin, however great or horrible, which cannot be effaced by
the Sacrament of Penance, and that not merely once, but over and
over again. On this point God Himself thus speaks through the
Prophet: If the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath
committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and
justice, living he shall live, and shall not die, and I will not
remember all his iniquities that he hath done. And St. John says:
If we confess our sins; he is faithful and just, to forgive us
our sins; and a little later, he adds: If any man sin, Â­Â­ he
excepts no sin whatever, Â­Â­ we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ, the just; for he is the propitiation for
our sins; and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole
world. </p>

<p>When we read in Scripture that certain persons did not obtain
pardon from God, even though they earnestly implored it, we know
that this was due to the fact that they had not a true and
heartfelt sorrow for their sins. Thus when we find in Sacred
Scripture and in the writings of the Fathers passages which seem
to assert that certain sins are irremissible, we must understand
the meaning to be that it is very difficult to obtain pardon for
them. A disease is sometimes called incurable, because the
patient is so disposed as to loathe the medicines that could
afford him relief. Ill the same way certain sins are not remitted
or pardoned because the sinner rejects the grace of God, the only
medicine for salvation. It is in this sense that St. Augustine
wrote: When a man who, through the grace of Jesus Christ, has
once arrived at a knowledge of God, wounds fraternal charity,
and, driven by the fury of envy, lifts up his head against grace,
the enormity of his sin is so great that, though compelled by a
guilty conscience to acknowledge and confess his fault, he finds
himself unable to submit to the humiliation of imploring pardon. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Necessity of the Sacrament of Penance</h3>

<p>Returning now to the Sacrament, it is so much the special
province of Penance to remit sins that it is impossible to obtain
or even to hope for remission of sins by any other means; for it
is written: Unless you do penance, you shall all likewise perish.
These words were said by our Lord in reference to grievous and
mortal sins, although at the same time lighter sins, which are
called venial, also require some sort of penance. St. Augustine
observes that the kind of penance which is daily performed in the
Church for venial sins, would be absolutely useless, if venial
sin could be remitted without penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Three Integral Parts of Penance</h3>

<p>But as it is not enough to speak in general terms when
treating of practical matters, the pastors should take care to
explain, one by one, those things from which the faithful can
understand the meaning of true and salutary Penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Their Existence</h3>

<p>Now it is peculiar to this Sacrament that besides matter and
form, which it has in common with all the other Sacraments, it
has also, as we have said, those parts which constitute Penance,
so to say, whole and entire; namely, contrition, confession and
satisfaction. On these St. Chrysostom thus speaks: Penance
enables the sinner to bear all willingly in his heart is
contrition; on his lips confession; in his actions entire
humility or salutary satisfaction. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Their Nature</h3>

<p>These three parts belong to that class of parts which are
necessary to constitute a whole. The human body is composed of
many members, Â­Â­ Â­hands, feet, eyes and the various other
parts; the want of any one of which makes the body be justly
considered imperfect, while if none of them is missing, the body
is regarded as perfect. In the same way, Penance is composed of
these three parts in such a way that though contrition and
confession, which justify man, are alone required to constitute
its essence, yet, unless accompanied by its third part,
satisfaction, it necessarily remains short of its absolute
perfection. </p>

<p>These three parts, then, are so intimately connected with one
another, that contrition includes the intention and resolution of
confessing and making satisfaction; contrition and the resolution
of making satisfaction imply confession; while the other two
precede satisfaction. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Necessity Of These Integral Parts</h3>

<p>The reason why these are the integral parts may be thus
explained. Sins against God are committed by thought, by word and
by deed. It is, then, but reasonable, that in recurring to the
power of the keys we should endeavour to appease God's wrath, and
obtain pardon for our sins by means of the very same things which
we employed to offend His sovereignty. </p>

<p>A further reason by way of confirmation can also be assigned.
Penance is a sort of compensation for sin, springing from the
free will of the delinquent, and is appointed by God, against
whom the offence has been committed. Hence, on the one hand,
there is required the willingness to make compensation, in which
willingness contrition chiefly consists; while, on the other
hand, the penitent must submit himself to the judgment of the
priest, who holds God's place, in order to enable him to award a
punishment proportioned to the gravity of the sin committed.
Hence the reason for and the necessity of confession and
satisfaction are easily inferred. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The First Part of Penance</h3>

<h3>Contrition</h3>

<p>As the faithful require instruction on the nature and efficacy
of the parts of Penance, we must begin with contrition. This
subject demands careful explanation; for as often as we call to
mind our past transgressions, or offend God anew, so often should
our hearts be pierced with contrition. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Meaning Of Contrition</h3>

<p>By the Fathers of the Council of Trent, contrition is defined:
A sorrow and detestation for sin committed, with a purpose of
sinning no more. and a little further on the Council, speaking of
the motion of the will to contrition, adds: If joined with a
confidence in the mercy of God and an earnest desire of per
forming whatever is necessary to the proper reception of the
Sacrament, it thus prepares us for the remission of sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Contrition Is A Detestation Of Sin </h3>

<p>From this definition, therefore, the faithful will perceive
that the efficacy of contrition does not simply consist in
ceasing to sin, or in resolving to begin, or having actually
begun a new life; it supposes first of all a hatred of one's
illÂ­spent life and a desire of atoning for past transgressions. </p>

<p>This is especially confirmed by those cries of the holy
Fathers,. which we so frequently meet with in Holy Scripture. I
have laboured in my groaning, says David; every night I will wash
my bed; and again, The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. I
will recount to thee all my years, says another, in the
bitterness of my soul. These and many like expressions were
called forth by an intense hatred and a lively detestation of
past transgressions. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Contrition Produces Sorrow</h3>

<p>But although contrition is defined as sorrow, the faithful are
not thence to conclude that this sorrow consists in sensible
feeling; for contrition is an act of the will, and, as St.
Augustine observes, grief is not penance but the accompaniment of
penance. By sorrow the Fathers understood a hatred and
detestation of sin; in the first place, because the Sacred
Scriptures frequently use the word in this sense. How long, says
David, shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all
the day. And secondly, because from contrition arises sorrow in
the inferior part of the soul which is called the seat of
concupiscence. </p>

<p>With propriety, therefore, is contrition defined a sorrow,
because it produces sorrow; hence penitents, in order to express
it, used to change their garments. Our Lord alludes to this
custom when He says: Woe to thee, Corozain, woe to thee,
Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles
that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in
sackÂ­cloth and ashes. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Names Of Sorrow For Sin</h3>

<p>To signify the intensity of this sorrow the name contrition
has rightly been given to the detestation of sin of which we
speak. The word means the breaking of an object into small parts
by means of a stone or some harder substance; and here it is used
metaphorically, to signify that our hearts, hardened by pride,
are beaten and broken by penance. Hence noÂ­other sorrow, not
even that which is felt for the death of parents, or children, or
for any other calamity, is called contrition. The word is
exclusively employed to express the sorrow with which we are
overwhelmed by the forfeiture of the grace of God and of our own
innocence. </p>

<p>Contrition, however, is often designated by other names.
Sometimes it is called contrition of heart, because the word
heart is frequently used in Scripture to express the will. As the
movement of the body originates in the heart, so the will is the
faculty which governs and controls the other powers of the soul. </p>

<p>By the holy Fathers it is also called compunction of heart,
and hence they preferred to entitle their works on contrition
treatises On Compunction of Heart; for as ulcers are lanced with
a knife in order to allow the escape of the poisonous matter
accumulated within, so the heart, as it were, is pierced with the
lance of contrition, to enable it to emit the deadly poison of
sin. </p>

<p>Hence, contrition is called by the Prophet Joel, a rending of
the heart. Be converted to me, he says, with all your hearts in
fasting, in weeping, in mourning, and rend your hearts. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Qualities of Sorrow for Sin</h3>

<h3>It Should Be Supreme</h3>

<p>That sorrow for sins committed should be so profound and
supreme that no greater sorrow could be thought of will easily
appear from the considerations that follow. </p>

<p>Perfect contrition is an act of charity, emanating from what
is called filial fear; hence it is clear that the measure of
contrition and of charity should be the same. Since, therefore,
the charity which we cherish towards God, is the most perfect
love, it follows that contrition should be the keenest sorrow of
the soul. God is to be loved above all things, and whatever
separates us from God is therefore to be hated above all things.
It is also worthy of note that to charity and contrition the
language of Scripture assigns the same extent. Of charity it is
said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart.' Of
contrition the Lord says through the Prophet: Be converted with
your whole heart. </p>

<p>Secondly, it is true that of all objects which deserve our
love, God is the supreme good, and it is not less true that of
all objects which deserve our execration sin is the supreme evil.
The same reason, then, which prompts us to confess that God is to
be loved above all things, obliges us also of necessity to
acknowledge that sin is to be hated above all things. That God is
to be loved above all things, so that we should be prepared to
sacrifice our lives rather than offend Him, these words of the
Lord clearly declare: He that loveth father or mother more than
me, is not worthy of me; He that will save his life shall lose
it. </p>

<p>Further, it should be noted that since, as St. Bernard says,
there is no limit or measure to charity, or to use his own words,
as the measure of loving God is to love Him without measure,
there should be no limit to the hatred of sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Sorrow For Sin Should Be Intense</h3>

<p>Besides, our contrition should be not only the greatest, but
also the most intense, and so perfect that it excludes all apathy
and indifference; for it is written in Deuteronomy: When thou
shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him: yet so if thou
seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy soul,
and in Jeremias.: Thou shalt seek me and shalt find me, when thou
shalt seek me unto all thy heart; and I will be found by thee,
saith the Lord. </p>

<p>If, however, our contrition be not perfect, it may
nevertheless be true and efficacious. For as things which fall
under the senses frequently touch the heart more sensibly than
things purely spiritual, it sometimes happens that persons feel
more intense sorrow for the death of their children than for the
grievousness of their sins. </p>

<p>Our contrition may also be true and efficacious, although
unaccompanied by tears. Penitential tears, however, are much to
be desired and commended. On this subject St. Augustine has well
said: The spirit of Christian charity lives not within you, if
you lament the body from which the soul has departed, but lament
not the soul from which God has departed. To the same effect are
the words of the Redeemer above cited: Woe to thee, Corozain, woe
to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the
miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long since done
penance, in sackÂ­cloth and ashes. To establish this truth it
will suffice to recall the well-known examples of the Ninivites,
of David, of the woman who was a sinner, and of the Prince of the
Apostles, all. of whom obtained the pardon of their sins when
they implored the mercy of God with abundant tears. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Sorrow For Sin Should Be Universal</h3>

<p>The faithful should be earnestly exhorted and admonished to
strive to extend their contrition to each mortal sin. For it is
thus that Ezechias describes contrition: I will recount to thee
all my years in the bitterness of my soul. To recount all our
years is to examine our sins one by one in order to have sorrow
for them from our hearts. In Ezechiel also we read: If the wicked
do penance for all his sins, he shall live. In this sense St.
Augustine says: Let the sinner consider the quality of his sins,
as to time, place, variety and person. </p>

<p>In this matter, however, the faithful should not despair of
the infinite goodness and mercy of God. For since God is most
desirous of our salvation, He will not delay to pardon us. With a
father's fondness, He embraces the sinner the moment he enters
into himself, turns to the Lord, and, having detested all his
sins, resolves that later on, as far as he is able, he will call
them singly to mind and detest them. The Almighty Himself, by the
mouth of His Prophet, commands us to hope, when He says: The
wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what day soever
he shall turn from his wickedness. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Conditions Required for Contrition</h3>

<p>From what has been said we may gather the chief requisites of
true contrition. In these the faithful are to be accurately
instructed, that each may know the means of attaining, and may
have a fixed standard by which to determine, how far he may be
removed from the perfection of this virtue. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Detestation Of Sin</h3>

<p>We must, then, in the first place, detest and deplore all out
sins. If our sorrow and detestation extend only to some sins, our
repentance is not salutary, but feigned and false. Whosoever
shall keep the whole law, says St. James, but offend in one
point, is become guilty of all. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Intention Of Confession And Satisfaction</h3>

<p>In the next place, our contrition must be accompanied with a
desire of confessing and satisfying for our sins. Concerning
these dispositions we shall treat in their proper place. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Purpose Of Amendment</h3>

<p>Thirdly, the penitent must form a fixed and firm purpose of
amendment of life. This the Prophet clearly teaches in the
following words: If the wicked do penance for all his sins which
he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment,
and justice, living Ice shall live, and shall not die: I will not
remember all his iniquities which he hath done. And a little
after: When the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness
which he hath wrought, and doth judgment and justice, he shall
save his soul alive. Still further on he adds: Be converted and
do penance for all your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be
your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which
you have transgressed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new
spirit. To the woman taken in adultery Christ our Lord commanded
the same thing: Go thy way, and sin no more; and also to the lame
man whom He cured at the pool of Bethsaida: Behold, thou art made
whole, sin no more. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Reasons For These Conditions</h3>

<p>That a sorrow for sin and a firm purpose of avoiding sin for
the future are two conditions indispensable to contrition nature
and reason clearly show. He who would be reconciled to a friend
whom he has wronged must regret to have injured and offended him,
and his future conduct must be such as to avoid offending in
anything against friendship. </p>

<p>Furthermore, these are conditions to which man is bound to
yield obedience; for the law to which man is subject, be it
natural, divine, or human, he is bound to obey. If, therefore, by
force or fraud, the penitent has taken anything from his
neighbour, he is bound to restitution. Likewise if, by word or
deed he has injured his neighbour's honour or reputation, he is
under an obligation of repairing the injury by procuring him some
advantage or rendering him some service. Well known to all is the
maxim of St. Augustine: The sin is not forgiven unless what has
been taken away is restored. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Forgiveness Of Injuries</h3>

<p>Again, not less necessary for contrition than the other chief
conditions is a care that it be accompanied by entire forgiveness
of the injuries which we may have received from others. This our
Lord and Saviour admonishes when He declares: If you will forgive
men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also
your offences, but if you will not forgive men, neither will your
Father forgive you your offences. </p>

<p>These are the conditions which the faithful should observe as
regards contrition. There are other dispositions which, although
not essential to true and salutary penance, contribute to render
contrition more perfect and complete in its kind, and which
pastors will readily discover. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Effects of Contrition</h3>

<p>Simply to make known those things which pertain to salvation
should not be deemed a full discharge of the duty of pastors;
their zeal and industry should be exerted to persuade the people
to adopt these truths as their rule of conduct and as the
governing principle of their actions. Hence it will be highly
useful often to explain the power and utility of contrition. </p>

<p>For whereas most other pious practices, such as alms, fasting,
prayer and similar holy and commendable works, are sometimes
rejected by God on account of the faults of those who perform
them, contrition can never be other than pleasing and acceptable
to Him. A contrite and humble heart, O God, exclaims the Prophet,
thou wilt not despise. </p>

<p>Nay more, the same Prophet declares elsewhere that, as soon as
we have conceived this contrition in our hearts, our sins are
forgiven by God: I said, I will confess my injustice to the Lord,
and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. Of this truth we
have a figure in the ten lepers, who, when sent by our Lord to
the priests, were cured of their leprosy before they had reached
them; which gives us to understand that such is the efficacy of
true contrition, of which we have spoken above, that through it
we obtain from the Lord the immediate pardon of all sins. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Means of Arousing True Contrition</h3>

<p>To move the faithful to contrition, it will be very useful if
pastors point out some method by which each one may excite
himself to contrition. </p>

<p>They should all be admonished frequently to examine their
consciences, in order to ascertain if they have been faithful in
the observance of those things which God and His Church require.
Should anyone be conscious of sin, he should immediately accuse
himself, humbly solicit pardon from God, and implore time to
confess and satisfy for his sins. Above all, let him supplicate
the aid of divine grace, in order that he may not relapse into
those sins which he now penitently deplores. </p>

<p>Pastors should also take care that the faithful be excited to
a supreme hatred of sin, both because its turpitude and baseness
are very great and because it brings us the gravest losses and
misfortunes. For sin deprives us of the friendship of God, to
whom we are indebted for so many invaluable blessings, and from
whom we might have expected and received gifts of still higher
value; and along with this it consigns us to eternal death and to
torments unending and most severe. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Second Part of Penance</h3>

<h3>Confession</h3>

<p>Having said so much on contrition, we now come to confession,
which is another part of Penance. The care and exactness which
its exposition demands of pastors must be at once obvious, if we
only reflect that most holy persons are firmly persuaded that
whatever of piety, of holiness, of religion, has been preserved
to our times in the Church, through God's goodness, must be
ascribed in great measure to confession. It cannot, therefore, be
a matter of surprise that the enemy of the human race, in his
efforts to destroy utterly the Catholic Church, should, through
the agency of the ministers of his wicked designs, have assailed
with all his might this bulwark, as it were, of Christian virtue.
It should be shown, therefore, in the first place that the
institution of confession is most useful and even necessary to
us. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Necessity Of Confession</h3>

<p>Contrition, it is true, blots out sin; but who does not know
that to effect this it must be so intense, so ardent, so
vehement, as to bear a proportion to the magnitude of the crimes
which it effaces? This is a degree of contrition which few reach;
and hence, in this way, very few indeed could hope to obtain the
pardon of their sins. It, therefore, became necessary that the
most merciful Lord should provide by some easier means for the
common salvation of men; and this He has done in His admirable
wisdom, by giving to His Church the keys of the kingdom of
heaven. </p>

<p>According to the doctrine of the Catholic Church, a doctrine
firmly to be believed and constantly professed by all, if the
sinner have a sincere sorrow for his sins and a firm resolution
of avoiding them in future, although he bring not with him that
contrition which may be sufficient of itself to obtain pardon,
all his sins are forgiven and remitted through the power of the
keys, when he confesses them properly to the priest. Justly,
then, do those most holy men, our Fathers, proclaim that by the
keys of the Church the gate of heaven is thrown open, a truth
which no one can doubt since the Council of Florence has decreed
that the effect of Penance is absolution from sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Advantages Of Confession</h3>

<p>To appreciate further the great advantages of confession we
may turn to a fact taught by experience. To those who have led
immoral lives nothing is found so useful towards a reformation of
morals as sometimes to disclose their secret thoughts, all their
words and actions, to a prudent and faithful friend, who can
assist them by his advice and cooperation. For the same reason it
must prove most salutary to those whose minds are agitated by the
consciousness of guilt to make known the diseases and wounds of
their souls to the priest, as the vicegerent of Christ our Lord,
bound to eternal secrecy by the strictest of laws. (In the
Sacrament of Penance) they will find immediate remedies, the
healing qualities of which will not only remove the present
malady, but will also have such a heavenly efficacy in preparing
the soul against an easy relapse into the same kind of disease
and infirmity. </p>

<p>Another advantage of confession, which should not be
overlooked, is that it contributes powerfully to the preservation
of social order. Abolish sacramental confession, and that moment
you deluge society with all sorts of secret and heinous crimes
Â­Â­ crimes too, and others of still greater enormity, which men,
once that they have been depraved by vicious habits, will not
dread to commit in open day. The salutary shame that attends
confession restrains licentiousness, bridles desire and checks
wickedness. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Definition Of Confession</h3>

<p>Having explained the advantages of confession, pastors should
next unfold its nature and efficacy. Confession, then, is
defined: A sacramental accusation of one's sins, made to obtain
pardon by virtue of the keys. </p>

<p>It is rightly called an accusation, because sins are not to be
told as if the sinner boasted of his crimes, as they do who are
glad when they have done evil; nor are they to be related as
stories told for the sake of amusing idle listeners. They are to
be confessed as matters of selfÂ­accusation, with a desire, as it
were, to avenge them on ourselves. </p>

<p>We confess our sins with a view to obtain pardon. In this
respect the tribunal of penance differs from other tribunals,
which take cognisance of capital offences, and before which a
confession of guilt does not secure acquittal and pardon, but
penalty and punishment. </p>

<p>The definition of confession by the holy Fathers, although
different in words, is substantially the same. Confession, says
St. Augustine, is the disclosure of a secret disease, with the
hope of obtaining pardon; and St. Gregory: Confession is a
detestation of sins. Both of these definitions accord with, and
are contained in the preceding definition. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Confession Instituted By Christ</h3>

<p>In the next place, it is a duty of greatest moment that
pastors should unhesitatingly teach that this Sacrament owes its
institution to the singular goodness and mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who has ordered all things well, and solely with a view
to our salvation. </p>

<p>After His Resurrection He breathed on the Apostles, assembled
together, saying: Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall
forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins you shall retain, they
are retained. Now in giving to priests the power to retain and
forgive sins, it is evident that our Lord made them also judges
in this matter. </p>

<p>Our Lord seems to have signified the same thing when, having
raised Lazarus from the dead, He commanded His Apostles to loose
him from the bands in which he was bound. This is the
interpretation of St. Augustine. The priests, he says, can now do
more: they can exercise greater clemency towards those who
confess and whose sins they forgive. The Lord, in giving over
Lazarus, whom He had already raised from the dead, to be loosed
by the hands of His disciples, wished us to understand that to
priests was given the power of loosing. </p>

<p>To this also refers the command given by our Lord to the
lepers cured on the way, that they show themselves to the
priests, and subject themselves to their judgment. </p>

<p>Invested, then, as they are, by our Lord with power to remit
and retain sins, priests are evidently appointed judges of the
matter on which they are to pronounce; and since, according to
the wise remark of the Council of Trent, we cannot form an
accurate judgment on any matter, or award to crime a just
proportion of punishment without having previously examined and
made ourselves well acquainted with the case, it follows that the
penitent is obliged to make known to the priests, through the
medium of confession, each and every sin. </p>

<p>This doctrine the pastors should teach as defined by the holy
Council of Trent, and handed down by the uniform doctrine of the
Catholic Church. An attentive perusal of the Fathers will present
passages throughout their works, proving in the clearest terms
that this Sacrament was instituted by our Lord, and that the law
of sacramental confession, which, from the Greek, they call
exomologesis, and exagoreusis, is to be received as true Gospel
teaching. </p>

<p>If we seek figures in the Old Testament, the different kinds
of sacrifices which were offered by the priests for the expiation
of different sorts of sins, seem, beyond all doubt, to have
reference to confession of sins. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Rites Added By The Church</h3>

<p>Not only are the faithful to be taught that confession was
instituted by our Lord. They are also to be reminded that, by
authority of the Church, certain rites and solemn ceremonies have
been added which, although not essential to the Sacrament, serve
to place its dignity more fully before the eyes of the penitent,
and to prepare his soul, so that, kindled with devotion, he may
more easily receive the grace of God. When, with uncovered head
and bended knees, with eyes fixed on the earth and hands raised
in supplication, and with other indications of Christian humility
not essential to the Sacrament, we confess our sins, our minds
are thus deeply impressed with a clear conviction of the heavenly
virtue of the Sacrament, and also of the necessity of most
earnestly beseeching and imploring the mercy of God. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Law of Confession</h3>

<p>Nor let it be supposed that, although confession was
instituted by our Lord, He did not declare its use to be
necessary. The faithful must be impressed with the conviction
that he who is dead in sin is to be recalled to spiritual life by
means of sacramental confession. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Proof Of The Obligation</h3>

<p>This truth is clearly conveyed by our Lord Himself, when, by a
most beautiful metaphor, He calls the power of administering this
Sacrament, the key of the kingdom of heaven. Just as no one can
enter any place without the help of him who has the keys, so no
one is admitted to heaven unless its gates be unlocked by the
priests to whose custody the Lord gave the keys. This power would
otherwise be of no use in the Church. If heaven can be entered
without the power of the keys, in vain would they to whom the
keys were given seek to prevent entrance within its portals. </p>

<p>This thought was familiar to the mind of St. Augustine. Let no
man, he says, say within himself: &quot;I repent in secret to the
Lord. God, who has power to pardon me, knows the inmost
sentiments of my heart.,, Was there, then, no reason for saying
&quot;whatsoever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in
heaven,&quot; no reason why the keys were given to the Church of
God? The same doctrine is taught by St. Ambrose in his treatise
On Penance, when refuting the heresy of the Novatians who
asserted that the power of forgiving sins belonged solely to
God.' Who, says he, yields greater reverence to God, he who obeys
or he who resists His commands? God commands us to obey His
ministers; and by obeying them, we honour God alone. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Age At Which The Law Of Confession Obliges
</h3>

<p>As the law of confession was no doubt enacted and established
by our Lord Himself, it is our duty to ascertain, on whom, at
what age, and at what period of the year, it becomes obligatory.
According to the canon of the Council of Lateran, which begins:
Omnis utriusque sexus, no person is bound by the law of
Confession until he has arrived at the use of reason, Â­Â­ a time
determinable by no fixed number of years. It may, however, be
laid down as a general principle, that children are bound to go
to confession as soon as they are able to discern good from evil,
and are capable of malice; for, when a person has arrived at an
age when he must begin to attend to the work of his salvation, he
is bound to confess his sins to a priest, since there is no other
salvation for one whose conscience is burdened with sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>At What Time The Law Of Confession Obliges</h3>

<p>In the same canon holy Church has defined the period within
which we are especially bound to discharge the duty of
confession. It commands all the faithful to confess their sins at
least once a year. If, however, we consult our eternal interests,
we will certainly not neglect to have recourse to confession as
often, at least, as we are in danger of death, or undertake to
perform any act incompatible with the state of sin, such as to
administer or receive the Sacraments. The same rule should be
strictly followed when we are apprehensive of forgetting some
sin, into which we may have fallen; for we cannot confess sins
unless we remember them, neither do we obtain pardon unless our
sins are blotted out through sacramental confession. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Qualities of Confession</h3>

<p>But since in confession many things are to be observed, some
of which are essential, some not essential to the Sacrament, all
these matters should be carefully treated. Access can easily be
had to works and treatises from which an explanation of all these
things can be drawn. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Confession Should Be Entire</h3>

<p>Pastors should teach, first of all, that care must be
exercised that confession be complete and entire. All mortal sins
must be revealed to the priest. Venial sins, which do not
separate us from the grace of God, and into which we frequently
fall, although they may be usefully confessed, as the experience
of the pious proves, may be omitted without sin, and expiated by
a variety of other means. Mortal sins, as we have already said,
are all to be confessed, even though they be most secret, or be
opposed only to the last two Commandments of the Decalogue. Such
secret sins often inflict deeper wounds on the soul than those
which are committed openly and publicly. </p>

<p>So the Council of Trent has defined, and such has been the
constant teaching of the Church, as the Fathers declare. St.
Ambrose speaks thus: Without the confession of his sin, no man
can be justified from his sin. In confirmation of the same
doctrine, St. Jerome, on Ecclesiastes, says: If the serpent, the
devil, has secretly and without the knowledge of a third person,
bitten anyone, and has infused into him the poison of sin; if
unwilling to disclose his wound to his brother or master, he is
silent and will not do penance, his master, who has a tongue
ready to cure him, can render him no service. The same doctrine
we find in St. Cyprian, in his sermon On the Fallen. Although
guiltless, he says, of the heinous crime of sacrificing to idols,
or of having purchased certificates to that effect; yet, as they
entertained the thought of doing so, they should confess it with
grief to the priests of God. In fine, such is the unanimous voice
and teaching of all the Doctors of the Church. </p>

<p>In confession we should employ all that care and exactness
which we usually bestow upon worldly concerns of great moment,
and all our efforts should be directed to the cure of our soul's
wounds and to the destruction of the roots of sin. We should not
be satisfied with the bare enumeration of our mortal sins, but
should mention such circumstances as considerably aggravate or
extenuate their malice. Some circumstances are so serious as of
themselves to constitute mortal guilt. On no account whatever,
therefore, are such circumstances to be omitted. Thus if one man
has killed another, he must state whether his victim was a layman
or an ecclesiastic. Or, if he has had sinful relations with a
woman, he must state whether the female was unmarried or married,
a relative or a person consecrated to God by vow. These
circumstances change the nature of the sins; so that the first
kind of unlawful intercourse is called by theologians simple
fornication, the second adultery, the third incest, and the
fourth sacrilege. Again, theft is numbered in the catalogue of
sins. But if a person has stolen one golden coin, his sin is less
grievous than if he had stolen a hundred or two hundred, or an
immense sum; and if the stolen money belonged to the Church, the
sin would be still more grievous. The same rule applies to the
circumstances of time and place, but' the examples are too well
known from many books to require mention here. Circumstances such
as these are, therefore, to be mentioned; but those which do not
considerably aggravate the malice of the sin may be lawfully
omitted. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Sins Concealed</h3>

<p>So important is it that confession be entire that if the
penitent confesses only some of his sins and wilfully neglects to
accuse himself of others which should be confessed, he not only
does not profit by his confession, but involves himself in new
guilt. Such an enumeration of sins cannot be called sacramental
confession; on the contrary, the penitent must repeat his
confession, not omitting to accuse himself of having, under the
semblance of confession, profaned the sanctity of the Sacrament. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Sins Forgotten</h3>

<p>But should the confession seem defective, either because the
penitent forgot some grievous sins, or because, although intent
on confessing all his sins, he did not examine the recesses of
his conscience with sufficient accuracy, he is not bound to
repeat his confession. It will be sufficient, when he recollects
the sins which he had forgotten, to confess them to a priest on a
future occasion. </p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that we are not to examine our
consciences with careless indifference, or to be so negligent in
recalling our sins as to seem as if unwilling to remember them.
Should this have been the case, the confession must by all means
be made over again. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Confession Should Be Plain, Simple, Sincere</h3>

<p>In the second place our confession should be plain, simple and
undisguised; not artfully made, as is the case with some who seem
more intent on defending themselves than on confessing their
sins. Our confession should be such as to disclose to the priest
a true image of our lives, such as we ourselves know them to be,
exhibiting as doubtful that which is doubtful, and as certain
that which is certain. If, then, we neglect to enumerate our
sins, or introduce extraneous matter, our confession, it is
clear, lacks this quality. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Confession Should Be Prudent, Modest, Brief</h3>

<p>Prudence and modesty in explaining matters of confession are
also much to be commended, and a superfluity of words is to be
carefully avoided. Whatever is necessary to make known the nature
of every sin is to be explained briefly and modestly. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Confession Should Be Made Privately And Often </h3>

<p>Secrecy as regards confession should be strictly observed, as
well by the penitent as by the priest. Hence, no one can, on any
account, confess by messenger or letter, because in those cases
secrecy would not be possible. </p>

<p>The faithful should be careful above all to cleanse their
consciences from sin by frequent confession. When a person is in
mortal sin nothing can be more salutary, so precarious is human
life, than to have immediate recourse to confession. But even if
we could promise ourselves a long life, yet it would be truly
disgraceful that we who are so particular in whatever relates to
cleanliness of dress or person, were not at least equally careful
in preserving the lustre of the soul unsullied from the foul
stains of sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Minister of the Sacrament of Penance</h3>

<h3>The Usual Minister</h3>

<p>We now come to treat of the minister of this Sacrament. That
the minister of the Sacrament of Penance must be a priest
possessing ordinary or delegated jurisdiction the laws of the
Church sufficiently declare. Whoever discharges this sacred
function must be invested not only with the power of orders, but
also with that of jurisdiction. Of this ministry we have an
illustrious proof in these words of our Lord, recorded by St.
John: Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and
whose sins you shall retain, they are retained, words addressed
not to all, but to the Apostles only, to whom, in this function
of the ministry, priests succeed. </p>

<p>This is also most fitting, for as all the grace imparted by
this Sacrament is communicated from Christ the Head to His
members, they who alone have power to consecrate His true body
should alone have power to administer this Sacrament to His
mystical body, the faithful, particularly as these are qualified
and disposed by means of the Sacrament of Penance to receive the
Holy Eucharist. </p>

<p>The scrupulous care which in the primitive ages of the Church
guarded the right of the ordinary priest is easily seen from the
ancient decrees of the Fathers, which provided that no Bishop or
priest, except in case of great necessity, presume to exercise
any function in the parish of another without the authority of
him who governed there. This law derives its sanction from the
Apostle when he commanded Titus to ordain priests in every city,
to administer to the faithful the heavenly food of doctrine and
of the Sacraments. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Minister In Danger Of Death</h3>

<p>In order that none may perish, if there is imminent danger of
death, and recourse cannot be had to the proper priest, the
Council of Trent teaches that according to the ancient practice
of the Church of God it is then lawful for any priest, not only
to remit all kinds of Sill, whatever faculties they might
otherwise require, but also to absolve from excommunication. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Qualifications Of The Minister</h3>

<p>Besides the powers of orders and of jurisdiction, which are of
absolute necessity, the minister of this Sacrament, holding as he
does the place at once of judge and physician, should be gifted
not only with knowledge and erudition, but also with prudence. </p>

<p>As judge, his knowledge, it is evident, should be more than
ordinary, for by it he is to examine into the nature of sins, and
among the various kinds of sins to judge which are grievous and
which are not, keeping in view the rank and condition of the
person. </p>

<p>As physician he has also occasion for consummate prudence, for
to him it belongs to administer to the diseased soul those
healing medicines which will not only effect the cure, but prove
suitable preservatives against its future contagion. </p>

<p>The faithful, therefore, will see the great care that each one
should take in selecting (as confessor) a priest, who is
recommended by integrity of life, by learning and prudence, who
is deeply impressed with the awful weight and responsibility of
the station which he holds, who understands well the punishment
due to every sin, and can also discern who are to be loosed and
who to be bound. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Confessor Must Observe The Seal Of
Confession </h3>

<p>Since each one is most anxious that his sins and defilements
should be buried in oblivion, the faithful are to be admonished
that there is no reason whatever to apprehend that what is made
known in confession will ever be revealed by the priest to
anyone, or that by it the penitent can at any time be brought
into danger of any sort. The laws of the Church threaten the
severest penalties against any priests who would fail to observe
a perpetual and religious silence concerning all the sins
confessed to them. Let the priest, says the great Council of
Lateran, take special care, neither by word or sign, nor by any
other means whatever, to betray in the least degree the sinner. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Duties of the Confessor towards Various
Classes of Penitents </h3>

<p>Having treated of the minister of this Sacrament, the order of
our matter requires that we next proceed to explain some general
heads which are of considerable importance with regard to the use
and practice of confession. </p>

<p>Many of the faithful, to whom, as a rule, no time seems to
pass so slowly as that which is appointed by the laws of the
Church for the duty of confession, are so removed from Christian
perfection that, far from bestowing attention on those other
matters which are obviously most efficacious in conciliating the
favour and friendship of God, they do not even try to remember
the sins that are to be confessed to the priest. </p>

<p>Since, therefore, nothing is to be omitted which can assist
the faithful in the important work of salvation, the priest
should be careful to observe if the penitent be truly contrite
for his sins, and deliberately and firmly resolved to avoid sin
for the future. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Well Disposed Should Be Exhorted To
Thanksgiving And Perseverance </h3>

<p>If the sinner is found to be thus disposed, he is to be
admonished and earnestly exhorted to pour out his heart in
gratitude to God for so great and so singular a blessing, and to
supplicate unceasingly the aid of divine grace, shielded by which
he may securely combat his evil propensities. </p>

<p>He should also be taught not to suffer a day to pass without
devoting a portion of it to meditation on some mystery of the
Passion of our Lord, and to exciting and inflaming himself to the
imitation and most ardent love of his Redeemer. The fruit of such
meditation will be to fortify him more and more every day against
all the assaults of the devil. For what other reason is there why
our courage sinks and our strength fails the moment the enemy
makes even the slightest attack on us, but that we neglect by
pious meditation to kindle within us the fire of divine love,
which animates and invigorates the soul? </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Indisposed Should Be Helped</h3>

<p>But should the priest perceive that the penitent is not truly
contrite, he will endeavour to inspire him with an anxious desire
for contrition, inflamed by which he may resolve to ask and
implore this heavenly gift from the mercy of God. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Those Who Seek To Excuse Their Sins Should Be
Corrected</h3>

<p>The pride of some who seek by vain excuses to justify or
extenuate their offences is carefully to be repressed. If, for
instance, a penitent confesses that he was wrought up to anger,
and immediately transfers the blame of the excitement to another,
who, he complains, was the aggressor, he is to be reminded that
such apologies are indications of a proud spirit, and of a man
who either thinks lightly of, or is unacquainted with the
enormity of his sin, while they serve rather to aggravate than to
extenuate his guilt. He who thus labours to justify his conduct
seems to say that then only will he exercise patience, when no
one injures him Â­Â­ a disposition than which nothing can be more
unworthy of a Christian. Instead of lamenting the state of him
who inflicted the injury he disregards the grievousness of the
sin, and is angry with his brother. Having had an opportunity of
honouring God by his exemplary patience, and of correcting a
brother by his meekness, he turns the very means of salvation to
his own destruction. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Those Who Are Ashamed To Confess Their Sins
Should Be Instructed </h3>

<p>Still more pernicious is the fault of those who, yielding to a
foolish bashfulness, cannot induce themselves to confess their
sins. Such persons are to be encouraged by exhortation, and are
to be reminded that there is no reason whatever why they should
fear to disclose their sins, that to no one can it appear
surprising if persons fall into sin, the common malady of the
human race and the natural consequence of human infirmity. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Careless Should Be Rebuked</h3>

<p>There are others who, either because they seldom confess their
sins, or because they have bestowed no care or attention on the
examination of their consciences, do not know well how to begin
or end their confession. Such persons deserve to be severely
rebuked, and are to be taught that before anyone approaches the
tribunal of Penance he should employ every diligence to excite
himself to contrition for his sins, and that this he cannot do
without endeavouring to know and recollect them severally. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Unprepared Should Be Dismissed Or Led To
Good Disposition </h3>

<p>Should the confessor meet persons of this class entirely
unprepared, he should dismiss them without harshness, exhorting
them in the kindest terms to take some time to reflect on their
sins, and then return; but should they declare that they have
already done everything in their power to prepare, and there is
reason to apprehend that if sent away they may not return, their
confession is to be heard, particularly if they manifest some
disposition to amend their lives and can be induced to accuse
their own negligence and promise to atone for it at another time
by a diligent and accurate scrutiny of conscience. In such cases,
however, the confessor should proceed with caution. If, after
having heard the confession, he is of the opinion that the
penitent did not entirely lack diligence in examining his
conscience or sorrow in detesting his sins, he may absolve him;
but if he has found him deficient in both, he should, as we have
already said, admonish him to use greater care in his examination
of conscience, and dismiss him as kindly as he can. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Pastor Should Show The Wrong Of Human
Respect </h3>

<p>But as it sometimes happens that females, who may have
forgotten some sin in a former confession, cannot bring
themselves to return to the confessor, dreading to expose
themselves before the people to the suspicion of having been
guilty of something grievous or of looking for the praise of
extraordinary piety, the pastor should frequently remind the
faithful, both publicly and privately, that no one is gifted with
so tenacious a memory as to be able to recollect all his
thoughts, words and actions; that the faithful, therefore, should
they call to mind some sin which they had previously forgotten,
should not be deterred from returning to the priest. These and
many other matters of the same nature demand the attention of
priests in confession. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Third Part of Penance</h3>

<h3>Satisfaction</h3>

<p>Let us now come to the third part of Penance, which is called
satisfaction. We shall begin by explaining its nature and
efficacy, because the enemies of the Catholic Church have on
these subjects taken ample occasion to sow discord and division,
to the serious detriment of Christians. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>General Meaning Of The Word
&quot;Satisfaction,&quot; </h3>

<p>Satisfaction is the full payment of a debt; for that is
sufficient or satisfactory to which nothing is wanting. Hence,
when we speak of reconciliation to favour, to satisfy means to do
what is sufficient to atone to the angered mind for an injury
offered; and in this sense satisfaction is nothing more than
compensation for an injury done to another. But, to come to the
object that now engages us, theologians make use of the word
satisfaction to signify the compensation man makes, by offering
to God some reparation for the sins he has committed. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Various Kinds Of Satisfaction To God</h3>

<p>This sort of satisfaction, since it has several degrees, can
be understood in various senses. </p>

<p>The first and highest degree of satisfaction is that by which
whatever we owe to God on account of our sins is paid abundantly,
even though He should deal with us according to the strictest
rigour of His justice. This degree of satisfaction appeases God
and renders Him propitious to us; and it is a satisfaction for
which we are indebted to Christ our Lord alone, who paid the
price of our sins on the cross, and offered to God a
superabundant satisfaction. No created being could have been of
such worth as to deliver us from so heavy a debt. He is the
propitiation for our sins, says St. John, and not for ours only
but also for those of the whole world. This satisfaction,
therefore, is full and superabundant, perfectly adequate to the
debt of all sins committed in this world. It gives to man's
actions great worth before God, and without it they would be
deserving of no esteem whatever. This David seems to have had in
view when, having asked himself, what shall I render to the
Â­Lord, for all the things that he hath rendered to me? and
finding nothing besides this satisfaction, which he expressed by
the word chalice, a worthy return for so many and such great
favours, he replied: I will take the chalice of salvation, and I
will call upon the name of the Lord. </p>

<p>There is another kind of satisfaction, which is called
canonical, and is performed within a certain fixed period of
time. Hence, according to the most ancient practice of the
Church, when penitents are absolved from their sins, some penance
is imposed, the performance of which is commonly called
satisfaction. </p>

<p>By the same name is called any sort of punishment endured for
sin, although not imposed by the priest, but spontaneously
undertaken and performed by ourselves. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Elements Of Sacramental Satisfaction</h3>

<p>This, however, does not belong to Penance as a Sacrament. Only
that satisfaction constitutes part of the Sacrament which, as we
have already said, is offered to God for sins at the command of
the priest. Furthermore, it must be accompanied by a deliberate
and firm purpose carefully to avoid sin for the future. </p>

<p>For to satisfy, as some define it, is to pay due honour to
God: and this, it is evident, no person can do, who is not
entirely resolved to avoid sin. Again, to satisfy is to cut off
all occasions of sin, and to close every avenue against its
suggestions. In accordance with this idea of satisfaction some
have defined it as a cleansing, which effaces whatever defilement
may remain in the soul from the stains of sin, and which exempts
us from the temporal chastisements due to sin. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Necessity Of Satisfaction</h3>

<p>Such being the nature of satisfaction, it will not be
difficult to convince the faithful of the necessity imposed on
the penitent of performing works of satisfaction. They are to be
taught that sin carries in its train two evils, the stain and the
punishment. Whenever the stain is effaced, the punishment of
eternal death is forgiven with the guilt to which it was due;
yet, as the Council of Trent declares, the remains of sin and the
temporal punishment are not always remitted. </p>

<p>Of this the Scriptures afford many conspicuous examples, such
as are found in the third chapter of Genesis, in the twelfth and
twentyÂ­second of Numbers, and in many other places. That of
David, however, is the best known and most striking. Although the
Prophet Nathan had announced to him: The Lord also hath taken
aÂ­way thy sin, thou shalt not , yet David voluntarily subjected
himself to the most severe penance, imploring night and day the
mercy of God in these words: Wash me yet more from my iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin; for I know my iniquity, and my sin is
always before me. Thus did he beseech the Lord to pardon not only
the crime, but also the punishment due to it, and to restore him,
cleansed from the remains of sin, to his former state of purity
and integrity. This he besought with most earnest supplications,
and yet the Lord punished his transgression with the loss of his
adulterous offspring, the rebellion and death of his beloved son
Absalom, and with the other chastisements and calamities with
which he had previously threatened him. </p>

<p>In Exodus, too, we read that though the Lord yielded to the
prayers of Moses and spared the idolatrous Israelites, yet He
threatened the enormity of their crime with heavy chastisement,
and Moses himself declared that the Lord would take severest
vengeance on it, even to the third and fourth generations. </p>

<p>That such was at all times the doctrine of the holy Fathers in
the Catholic Church, their own testimony most clearly proves. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Advantages of Satisfaction</h3>

<h3>It Is Required By God's Justice And Mercy</h3>

<p>Why in the Sacrament of Penance, as in that of Baptism, the
punishment due to sin is not entirely remitted is admirably
explained in these words of the Council of Trent: Divine justice
seems to require that they who through ignorance sinned before
Baptism, should recover the friendship of God in a different
manner from those who, after they have been freed from the
thraldom, of sin and the devil and have received the gifts of the
Holy Ghost, dread not knowingly to violate the temple of God and
grieve the Holy Spirit. It is also in keeping with the divine
mercy not to remit our sins without any satisfaction, lest,
taking occasion hence, and imagining our sins less grievous than
they are, we should become injurious, as it were, and
contumelious to the Holy Ghost, and should fall into greater
enormities, treasuring up to ourselves wrath against the day of
wrath. These satisfactory penances have, no doubt, great
influence in recalling from and, as it were, bridling against
sin, and in rendering the sinner more vigilant and cautious for
the future. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Satisfaction Atones To The Church</h3>

<p>Furthermore (these satisfactions) serve as testimonies of our
sorrow for sin committed, and thus atone to the Church which is
grievously insulted by our crimes. God, says St. Augustine,
despises not a contrite and humble heart; but, as heartfelt grief
is generally concealed from others, and is not manifested by
words or other signs, wisely, therefore, are penitential times
appointed by those who preside over the Church, in order to atone
to the Church, in which sins are forgiven. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Satisfaction Deters Others From Sin</h3>

<p>Besides, the example presented by our penitential practices
serves as a lesson to others, how to regulate their lives and
practice piety. Seeing the punishments inflicted on sin, they
must feel the necessity of using the greatest circumspection
through life, and of correcting their former habits. </p>

<p>The Church, therefore, with great wisdom ordained that when
anyone had committed a public crime, a public penance should be
imposed on him, in order that others, being deterred by fear,
might more carefully avoid sin in future. This has sometimes been
observed even with regard to secret sins of more than usual
gravity. </p>

<p>But with regard to public sinners, as we have already said,
they were never absolved until they had performed public penance.
During the performance of this penance, the pastors poured out
prayers to God for their salvation, and ceased not to exhort the
penitents to do the same. In this respect, great was the care and
solicitude of St. Ambrose, of whom it is related that many who
came to the tribunal of Penance with hardened hearts were so
softened by his tears as to conceive the sorrow of true
contrition. But in process of time the severity of ancient
discipline was so relaxed and charity grew so cold, that in our
days many of the faithful think inward sorrow of soul and grief
of heart unnecessary for obtaining pardon, imagining that a mere
appearance of sorrow is sufficient. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>By Satisfaction We Are Made Like Unto Christ </h3>

<p>Again, by undergoing these penances we are made like unto
Jesus Christ our Head, inasmuch as He Himself suffered and was
tempted. As St. Bernard observes, nothing can appear so unseemly
as a delicate member under a head crowned with thorns. To use the
words of the Apostle: We are jointÂ­heirs with Christ, yet so if
we suffer with him; and again, If we be dead with him, we shall
live also with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Satisfaction Heals The Wounds Of Sin</h3>

<p>St. Bernard also observes that sin produces two effects: a
stain on the soul and a wound; that the stain is removed through
the mercy of God, while to heal the wound inflicted by sin the
remedy of penance is most necessary. When a wound has been
healed, some scars remain which demand attention; likewise, with
regard to the soul, after the guilt of sin is forgiven, some of
its effects remain, from which the soul requires to be cleansed. </p>

<p>St. Chrysostom fully confirms the same doctrine when he says:
It is not enough that the arrow has been extracted from the body;
the wound which it inflicted must also be healed. So with regard
to the soul, it is not enough that sin has been pardoned; the
wound which it has left must also be healed by penance. </p>

<p>St. Augustine also frequently teaches that penance exhibits at
once the mercy and the justice of God, Â­Â­ His mercy by which He
pardons sin and the eternal punishment due to sin; His justice by
which He exacts temporary punishment from the sinner. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Satisfaction Disarms The Divine Vengeance</h3>

<p>Finally, the punishment which the sinner endures disarms the
vengeance of God and averts the punishments decreed against us.
Thus the Apostle says: If we would judge ourselves, we should not
be judged; but whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the
Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. If all this is
explained to the faithful, it must have great influence in
exciting them to perform works of penance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Source of the Efficacy of Satisfactory Works </h3>

<p>Of the great efficacy of penance we may form some idea, if we
reflect that it arises entirely from the merits of the Passion of
Christ our Lord. It is His Passion that imparts to our good
actions two greatest advantages: the first, that we may merit the
rewards of eternal glory, so that a cup of cold water given in
His name shall not be without its reward; the second, that we may
be able to satisfy for our sins. </p>

<p>Nor does this lessen the most perfect and superabundant
satisfaction of Christ our Lord, but, on the contrary, renders it
still more conspicuous and illustrious. For the grace of Christ
is seen to abound more, inasmuch as it communicates to us not
only what He merited and paid of Himself alone, but also what, as
Head, He merited and paid in His members, that is, in holy and
just men. Hence it can be seen how such great weight and dignity
belong to the good actions of the pious. For Christ our Lord
continually infuses His grace into the devout soul united to Him
by charity, as the head to the members, or as the vine through
the branches. This grace always precedes, accompanies and follows
our good works, and without it we can have no merit, nor can we
at all satisfy God. </p>

<p>Hence it is that nothing seems wanting to the just. Through
their works done by the power of God, they are able, on the one
hand, to satisfy God's law, as far as their human and mortal
condition will allow; and, on the other hand, they can merit
eternal life, to the fruition of which they will be admitted if
they die in the state of God's grace. Well known are the words of
the Saviour: He that shall drink of the water that I will give
him shall not thirst for ever; but the water that I will give him
shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life
everlasting. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Conditions for Satisfaction</h3>

<p>In satisfaction two things are particularly required: the one,
that he who satisfies be in a state of grace, the friend of God,
since works done without faith and charity cannot be acceptable
to God; the other, that the works performed be such as are of
their own nature painful or laborious. They are a compensation
for past sins, and, to use the words of the holy martyr Cyprian,
the redeemers, as it were, of past sins, and must, therefore, in
some way be disagreeable. </p>

<p>It does not, however, always follow that they are painful or
laborious to those who undergo them. The influence of habit, or
the intensity of divine love, frequently renders the soul
insensible to things the most difficult. Such works, however, do
not therefore cease to be satisfactory. It is the privilege of
the children of God to be so inflamed with His love, that while
undergoing the most cruel tortures, they are either almost
insensible to them, or bear them all with the greatest joy. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Works Of Satisfaction Are Of Three Kinds</h3>

<p>Pastors should teach that all kinds of satisfaction are
reducible to three heads: prayer, fasting and almsdeeds, which
correspond to three kinds of goods which we have received from
God, those of the soul, those of the body and what are called
external goods. </p>

<p>Nothing can be more effectual in uprooting all sin from the
soul than these three kinds of satisfaction. For since whatever
is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh, the
concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, everyone can
see that to these three causes of disease are opposed also three
remedies. To the first is opposed fasting; to the second,
almsdeeds; to the third, prayer. </p>

<p>Moreover, if we consider those whom our sins injure, we shall
easily perceive why all kinds of satisfaction are reduced
especially to these three. For those (we offend by our sins) are:
God, our neighbour and ourselves. God we appease by prayer, our
neighbour we satisfy by alms, and ourselves we chastise by
fasting. </p>

<p>As this life is chequered by many and various afflictions, the
faithful are to be particularly reminded that those who patiently
bear all the trials and afflictions coming from the hand of God
acquire abundant satisfaction and merit; whereas those who suffer
with reluctance and impatience deprive themselves of all the
fruits of satisfaction, merely enduring the punishment which the
just judgment of God inflicts upon their sins. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>One Can Satisfy For Another</h3>

<p>In this the supreme mercy and goodness of God deserve our
grateful acknowledgment and praise, that He has granted to our
frailty the privilege that one may satisfy for another. This,
however, is a privilege which is confined to the satisfactory
part of Penance alone. As regards contrition and confession, no
one is able to be contrite for another; but those who are in the
state of grace may pay for others what is due to God, and thus we
may be said in some measure to bear each other's burdens. </p>

<p>This is a doctrine on which the faithful cannot for a moment
entertain a doubt, since we profess in the Apostle's Creed our
belief in the Communion of Saints. For since we are all reborn to
Christ in the same cleansing waters of Baptism and are partakers
of the same Sacraments, and, above all, are nourished with the
same body and blood of Christ our Lord, as our food and drink, we
are all, it is manifest, members of the same body. As then the
foot does not perform its functions solely for itself, but also
for the sake of the eyes, and as the eyes see not only for their
own sake, but for the general good of all the members, so also
works of satisfaction must be considered common to us all. </p>

<p>This, however, is not true in reference to all the advantages
to be derived from satisfaction. For works of satisfaction are
also medicinal, and are so many remedies prescribed to the
penitent to heal the depraved affections of the soul. It is clear
that those who do not satisfy for themselves can have no share in
this fruit of penance. </p>

<p>These three parts of Penance, contrition, confession and
satisfaction, should be fully and clearly explained. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Duties of the Confessor as Regards
Satisfaction </h3>

<h3>Restitution Must Be Insisted On</h3>

<p>Above all, priests should be very careful not to give
absolution to any penitent, whose confession they have heard,
without obliging him to make full satisfaction for any injury to
his neighbour's goods or character for which he seems
responsible. No person is to be absolved until he has first
faithfully promised to restore all that belongs to others. </p>

<p>But as there are many who readily promise to comply with their
duty in this respect, yet are deliberately determined never to
fulfil their promises, these persons should be obliged to make
restitution, and the words of the Apostle are to be frequently
pressed upon their minds: He that stole, let him now steal no
more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing
which is good, that he may have something to give to him that
suffereth need. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Quantity And Quality Of Penances Should Be
Reasonable </h3>

<p>In imposing penance priests should do nothing arbitrarily, but
should be guided solely by justice, prudence and piety. In order
to show that they follow this rule, and also to impress more
deeply on the mind of the penitent the enormity of his sin, it
will be useful sometimes to remind him of the severe punishments
inflicted by the ancient penitential canons, as they are called,
for certain sins. The nature of the sin, therefore, will regulate
the extent of the satisfaction. </p>

<p>No satisfaction can be more salutary than to require of the
penitent to devote, for a certain number of days, some time to
prayer, not omitting to pray to God in behalf of all mankind, and
particularly for those who have departed this life in the Lord. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Voluntary Works Of Penance Should Be
Recommended </h3>

<p>Penitents should also be exhorted to undertake of their own
accord the frequent performance of the penances imposed by the
confessor, and thus so to conduct their lives that, having
faithfully complied with everything which the Sacrament of
Penance demands, they may never cease earnestly to practice the
virtue of penance. </p>

<p>PUBLIC PENANCES SHOULD SOMETIMES BE GIVEN </p>

<p>Should it be deemed proper sometimes to visit public crimes
with public penance, and should the penitent express great
reluctance of seek to escape from its performance, he should not
be listened to too readily, but should be persuaded to embrace
with cheerfulness and readiness that which will be salutary to
himself and to others. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Admonition</h3>

<p>These things concerning the Sacrament of Penance and its
several parts should be taught in such a manner as to enable the
faithful not only to understand them perfectly, but also, with
the Lord's help, to resolve to put them in practice piously and
religiously. </p>
