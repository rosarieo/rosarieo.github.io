<h3><center>THE THIRD PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER:
&quot;<i>THY WILL BE DONE</i>&quot;</center></h3>

<h3>The Relation Of This Petition To The Previous One</h3>

<p>Whoever desires to enter into the kingdom of heaven should ask
of God that His will may be done. For Christ the Lord has said:
Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father who is
in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Consequently this Petition follows immediately after the one
which prays for the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of This Petition</h3>

<p>In order that the faithful may know the necessity of this
Petition and the numerous and salutary gifts which we obtain
through it, the pastor should direct their attention to the
misery and wretchedness in which the sin of Adam has involved
mankind.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Man's Proneness To Act Against God's Will</h3>

<p>From the beginning God implanted in all creatures an inborn
desire of pursuing their own happiness that, by a sort of natural
impulse, they may seek and desire their own end, from which they
never deviate, unless impeded by some external obstacle.­ This
impulse of seeking God, the author and father of his happiness,
was in the beginning all the more noble and exalted in man
because of the fact that he was endowed with reason and judgment.
But, while irrational creatures, which, at their creation were by
nature Food, continued, and still continue in that original state
and­condition, unhappy man went astray, and lost not only
original justice, with which he had been supernaturally gifted
and adorned by God, but also obscured that singular inclination
toward virtue which had been implanted in his soul. All, He says,
have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together; there is
none that doth good, no, not one. For the imagination and thought
of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth. Hence it is not
difficult to perceive that of himself no man is wise unto
salvation; that all are prone to evil; and that man has
innumerable corrupt propensities, since he tends downwards and is
carried with ardent precipitancy to anger, hatred, pride.
ambition, and to almost every species of evil.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Man's Blindness Concerning God's Will</h3>

<p>Although man is continually beset by these evils, yet his
greatest misery is that many of these appear to him not to be
evils at all. It is a proof of the most calamitous condition of
man, that he is so blinded by passion and cupidity as not to see
that what he deems salutary generally contains a deadly poison,
that he rushes headlong after those pernicious evils as if they
were good and desirable, while those things which are really good
and virtuous are shunned as the contrary. Of this false estimate
and corrupt judgment of man God thus expresses His detestation:
Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness
for light and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and
sweet for bitter.</p>

<p> In order, therefore, to delineate in vivid coloring the
misery of our condition, the Sacred Scripture compares us to
those who have lost their sense of taste and who, in consequence,
loathe wholesome food, and prefer that which is unwholesome.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Man's Weakness In Fulfilling God's Will</h3>

<p>It also compares us to sick persons who, as long as their
malady lasts, are incapable of fulfilling the duties and offices
proper to persons of sound and vigorous health. In the same way
neither can we, without the assistance of divine grace, undertake
actions such as are acceptable to God. Even should we, while in
this condition, succeed in doing anything good, it will be of
little or no avail towards attaining the bliss of heaven. But to
love and serve God as we ought is something too noble and too
sublime for us to accomplish by human powers in our present lowly
and feeble condition, unless we are assisted by the grace of God.</p>

<p> Another very apt comparison to denote the miserable condition
of mankind is that wherein we are likened to children who, if
left to go their own way, are thoughtlessly attracted by
everything that presents itself. Truly we are children,
thoughtless children, wholly devoted to vain conversations and
frivolous actions, once we become destitute of divine assistance;
and hence the reproof which divine wisdom directs against us: O
children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet
those things which are hurtful to themselves? while the Apostle
thus exhorts us: Do not become children in sense.</p>

<p> Not only this, but our folly and blindness are even greater
than those of children; for they are merely destitute of human
prudence which they can of themselves acquire in course of time;
whereas, if not assisted by God's help and grace, we can never
aspire to that divine prudence which is so necessary to
salvation. And if God's assistance should fail us, we at once
cast aside those things that are truly good and rush headlong to
voluntary ruin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Remedy For These Evils</h3>

<p>But should this darkness of spirit be removed with God's help;
should we but perceive these our miseries; and, shaking off our
insensibility, should we take account of the presence of the law
of the members and recognise the struggle of the senses against
the law of the spirit; and were we aware of every inclination of
our nature to evil; how in that event could we fail to seek with
earnest endeavour a suitable remedy for the great evils with
which our nature is oppressed, and how fail to sigh for that
salutary rule in accordance with which every Christian's life
should be modelled and guided?</p>

<p> Now this is what we ask when we address to God these words:
Thy will be done. We fell into this state of misery by disobeying
and despising the divine will. God vouchsafes to propose to us,
as the sole corrective of such great evils, a conformity to His
will, which by sinning we despised; He commands us to regulate
all our thoughts and actions by this standard. Now it is
precisely His help to accomplish this that we ask when we
suppliantly address to God the prayer, Thy will be done.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Man's Passions Rebel Against God's Will</h3>

<p>The same should also be the fervent prayer of those in whose
souls God­already reigns; who have been already illumined with
the divine light, which enables them to obey the will of God.
Although thus prepared, they have still to struggle against their
own passions on account of the tendency to evil implanted in
man's sensual appetite. Hence even though we are of the number of
the just, we are still exposed to great danger from our own
frailty, and should always fear lest, drawn aside and allured by
our concupiscences, which war in our members, we should again
stray from the path of salvation. Of this danger Christ the Lord
admonishes us in these words: Watch ye and pray that ye enter not
into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is
weak.</p>

<p> It is not in the power of man, not even of him who has been
justified by the grace of God, to reduce the irregular desires of
the flesh to such a state of utter subjection that they may never
afterwards rebel. By justifying grace God no doubt heals the
wounds of the soul; but not those also of the flesh concerning
which the Apostle wrote: J know that there dwelleth not in me,
that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good.</p>

<p> The moment the first man forfeited original justice, which
enabled him to bridle the passions, reason was no longer able to
restrain them within the bounds of duty, or to repress those
inordinate desires which are repugnant to reason. This is why the
Apostle tells us that sin, that is to say, the incentive to sin,
dwells in the flesh, thus giving us to understand that it does
not make a mere temporary stay within us as a passing guest, but
that as long as we live it maintains its abode in our members as
a permanent inhabitant of the body.</p>

<p> Continually beset as we are by our domestic and interior
enemies, it is easy for us to understand that we must fly to
God's help and beg of Him that His will may be done in us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Thy Will&quot;</h3>

<p>Though the faithful are not to be left in ignorance of the
import of this Petition, yet in this connection many questions
concerning the will of God may be passed over which are discussed
at great length and with much utility by scholastic doctors.
Accordingly we shall content ourselves with saying that by the
will of God is here meant that will which is commonly called the
will of sign; that is to say, whatever God has commanded or
counselled us to do or to avoid.</p>

<p> Hence, under the word will are here comprised all things that
have been proposed to us as a means of securing the happiness of
heaven, whether they regard faith or whether they regard morals,
all, in a word, that Christ the Lord has commanded or forbidden
either directly or through His Church. It is of this will that
the Apostle thus writes: Become not unwise, but understand what
is the will of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Be Done&quot;</h3>

<h3>We Ask That We May Fulfil What God Desires Of Us</h3>

<p>When, therefore, we pray, Thy will be done, we first of all
ask our heavenly Father to give us the strength to obey His
Commandments, and to serve Him in holiness and justice all our
days; to do all things according to His will and pleasure; to
discharge all the duties prescribed for us in Sacred Scripture;
under His guidance and assistance to perform all that becomes
those who are born, not of the will of the flesh but of God, thus
following the example of Christ the Lord who was made obedient
unto death, even unto the death of the cross; finally, to be
ready to bear all things rather than depart from His holy will in
even the slightest degree. </p>

<p> Assuredly there is no one who burns with a more ardent desire
and anxiety to obtain (the effect of this Petition) than he who
has been so blessed as to be able to understand the sublime
dignity attaching to those who obey God. For such a one
thoroughly understands how true it is to say that to serve God
and obey Him is to reign. Whoever, says the Lord, shall do the
will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister
and mother that is to say, to him am I attached by the closest
bonds of good will and love. </p>

<p> The Saints, with scarcely a single exception, failed not to
make the principal gift contemplated by this Petition the object
of their fervent prayers to God. All, indeed, have in substance
made use of this admirable prayer, but not unfrequently in
different words. David, whose strains breathe such wondrous
sweetness, pours out the same prayer in various aspirations: O !
that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications; Lead me
into the path of thy commandments; Direct my steps according to
thy word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me. In the same
spirit he says: Give me understanding, and I will learn thy
commandments; Teach me thy judgments; Give me understanding that
I may know thy testimonies. He often expresses and repeats the
same sentiment in other words. These passages should be carefully
noticed and explained to the faithful, that all may know and
comprehend the greatness and profusion of salutary gifts which
are comprehended in the first part of this Petition.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask That We May Not Yield To Our Own Inordinate
Desires </h3>

<p>In the second place, when we say, Thy will be done, we express
our detestation of the works of the flesh, of which the Apostle
writes: The works of the flesh are manifest, which are
fornication, uncleanness immodesty, lust, etc.; if you live
according to the flesh you shall die. We also beg of God not to
suffer us to yield to the suggestions of sensual appetite, of our
lusts, of our infirmities, but to govern our will by His will. </p>

<p> The sensualist, whose every thought and care is absorbed in
the transient things of this world, is estranged from the will of
God. Borne along by the tide of passion, he indulges his
licentious appetites. In this gratification he places all his
happiness, and considers that man happy who obtains whatever he
desires. We, the contrary, beseech God in the language of the
Apostle that we make not provision for the flesh in its
concupiscence, but that His will be done.</p>

<p> We are not easily induced to entreat God not to satisfy our
inordinate desires. This disposition of soul is difficult of
attainment, and by offering such a prayer we seem in some sort to
hate ourselves. To those who are slaves to the flesh such conduct
appears folly; but be it ours cheerfully to incur the imputation
of folly for the sake of Christ who has said: If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself. This is especially so since
we know that it is much better to desire what is right and just,
than to obtain what is opposed to reason and religion and to the
laws of God. Unquestionably the condition of the man who attains
the gratification of his rash and inordinate desires is less
enviable than that of him who does not obtain the object of his
pious prayers. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask That Our Mistaken Requests Be Not Granted </h3>

<p>Our prayers, however, have not solely for object that God
should deny us what accords with our desires, when it is clear
that they are depraved; but also that He would not grant us those
things for which, under the persuasion and impulse of the devil,
who transforms himself into an Angel of light, we sometimes pray,
believing them to be good.</p>

<p> The desire of the Prince of the Apostles to dissuade the Lord
from His determination to meet death, appeared not less
reasonable than religious; yet the Lord severely rebuked him,
because he was led, not by supernatural motives, but by natural
feeling. </p>

<p> What stronger proof of love towards the Lord than that shown
by the request of St. James and St. John, who, filled with
indignation against the Samaritans for refusing to entertain
their Master, besought Him to command fire to descend from heaven
and consume those hard­hearted and inhuman men? Yet they were
reproved by Christ the Lord in these words: You know not of what
spirit you are; the son of man came not to destroy souls but to
save them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask That Even Our Good Requests Be Granted Only
When They Are According To God's Will</h3>

<p>We should beseech God that His will be done, not only when our
desires are wrong, or have the appearance of wrong. We should ask
this even when the object of our desire is not really evil, as
when the will, obeying its instinctive impulse, desires what is
necessary for our preservation, and rejects what seems to be
opposed thereto. When about to pray for such things we should say
from our hearts, Thy will be done, in imitation of the example of
Him from whom we receive salvation and the science of salvation,
who, when agitated by a natural dread of torments and of a cruel
death, bowed in that horror of supreme sorrow with meek
submission to the will of His heavenly Father: Not my will but
thine be done. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask That God May Perfect In Us What His Grace Has
Begun </h3>

<p>But, such is the degeneracy of our nature that, even when we
have done violence to our passions and subjected them to the will
of God, we cannot avoid sin without His assistance, by which we
are protected from evil and directed in the pursuit of good. To
this Petition, therefore, we must have recourse, beseeching God
to perfect in us those things which He has begun; to repress the
turbulent emotions of passion; to subject our sensual appetites
to reason; in a word, to render us entirely conformable to His
holy will.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask That All May Know God's Will</h3>

<p>We pray that the whole world may receive the knowledge of
God's will, that the mystery of God, hidden from all ages and
generations, may be made known to all.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;On Earth as it is in Heaven&quot;</h3>

<p>We also pray for the standard and model of this obedience,
that our conformity to the will of God be regulated according to
the rule observed in heaven by the blessed Angels and choirs of
heavenly spirits, that, as they willingly and with supreme joy
obey God, we too may yield a cheerful obedience to His will in
the manner most acceptable to Him.</p>

<p> God requires that in serving Him we be actuated by the
greatest love and by the most exalted charity; that although we
devote ourselves entirely to Him with the hope of receiving
heaven as reward, yet the reason we look forward to that reward
should be that the Divine Majesty has commanded us to cherish
that hope. Let all our hopes, therefore, be based on the love of
God, who promises to reward our love with eternal happiness. </p>

<p> There are some who serve another with love, but who do so
solely with a view to some recompense, which is the end and aim
of their love; while others, influenced by love and loyalty
alone, look to nothing else in the services which they render
than the goodness and worth of him whom they serve, and, knowing
and admiring his qualities consider themselves happy in being
able to render him these services. This is the meaning of the
clause On earth as it is in heaven appended (to the Petition). </p>

<p> It is then, our duty to endeavour to the best of our ability
to be obedient to God, as we have said the blessed spirits are,
whose profound obedience is praised by David in the Psalm in
which he sings: Bless the Lord, all ye hosts; ye ministers of his
that do his will.</p>

<p> Should anyone, adopting the interpretation of St. Cyprian,
understand the words in heaven, to mean in the good and the
pious, and the words on earth, in the wicked and the impious, we
do not disapprove of the interpretation, by the word heaven
understanding the spirit, and by the word earth, the flesh, that
every person and every creature may in all things obey the will
of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>This Petition Contains an Act of Thanksgiving </h3>

<p>This Petition also includes thanksgiving. We revere the most
holy will of God, and in transports of joy celebrate all His
works with the highest praise and acknowledgment, being assured
that He has done all things well. It is certain that God is
omnipotent; and the consequence necessarily forces itself on the
mind that all things were created at His command. We also confess
the truth that He is the supreme Good. We must, therefore,
confess that all His works are good, for to all He imparted His
own goodness. But if we cannot fathom in everything the divine
plan, let us in all things banish every doubt and hesitation from
the mind, and with the Apostle declare that his ways are
unsearchable. </p>

<p> But the most powerful incentive to revere the will of God is
that He has deigned to illumine by His heavenly light; for, He
hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
us into the kingdom of the Son of his love.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Dispositions that should Accompany this Petition </h3>

<h3>A Sense Of Our Own Weakness Of Will</h3>

<p>To close our exposition of this Petition we must revert to a
subject at which we glanced in the beginning. It is that the
faithful in uttering this Petition should be humble and lowly in
spirit: keeping in view the violence of their inborn passions
which revolt against the will of God; recollecting that in this
duty (of obedience) man is excelled by all other creatures, of
whom it is written: All things serve thee; and reflecting, that
he who is unable without divine help to undertake, not to say,
perform, anything acceptable to God, must be very weak indeed. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Appreciation Of The Dignity Of Doing God's Will </h3>

<p>But as there is nothing greater, nothing more exalted, as we
have already said, than to serve God and live in obedience to His
law and Commandments, what more desirable to a Christian than to
walk in the ways of the Lord, to think nothing, to undertake
nothing, at variance with His will? In order that the faithful
may adopt this rule of life, and adhere to it with greater
fidelity, (the pastor) should borrow from Scripture examples of
individuals, who, by not referring their views to the will of
God, have failed in all their undertakings.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Resignation To God's Will</h3>

<p>Finally, the faithful are to be admonished to acquiesce in the
simple and absolute will of God. Let him, who thinks that he
occupies a place in society inferior to his deserts, bear his lot
with patient resignation; let him not abandon his proper sphere,
but abide in the vocation to which he has been called. Let him
subject his own judgment to the will of God, who provides better
for our interests than we can even desire ourselves. If troubled
by poverty, by sickness, by persecution, or afflictions and
anxieties of any sort, let us be convinced that none of these
things can happen to us without the permission of God, who is the
supreme Arbiter of all things. We should, therefore, not suffer
our minds to be too much disturbed by them, but bear up against
them with fortitude, having always on our lips the words: The
will of the Lord be done; and also those of holy Job, As it hath
pleased the Lord, so it is done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>
