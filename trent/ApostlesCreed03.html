<h3><center>ARTICLE III : &quot;WHO WAS CONCEIVED BY THE
HOLY GHOST, BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>From what has been said in the preceding Article, the faithful
can understand that in bringing us from the relentless tyranny of
Satan into liberty, God has conferred a singular and surpassing
blessing on the human race. But if we place before our eyes also
the plan and means by which He deigned chiefly to accomplish
this, then, indeed, we shall see that there is nothing more
glorious or magnificent than this divine goodness and beneficence
towards us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part of this Article:</h3>

<h3>&quot;Who was Conceived,&quot;</h3>

<p>The pastor, then, should enter on the exposition of this third
Article by developing the grandeur of this mystery, which the
Sacred Scriptures very frequently propose for our consideration
as the principal source of our eternal salvation. Its meaning he
should teach to be that we believe and confess that the same
Jesus Christ, our only Lord, the Son of God, when He assumed
human flesh for us in the womb of the Virgin, was not conceived
like other men, from the seed of man, but in a manner
transcending the order of nature, that is, by the power of the
Holy Ghost; so that the same Person, remaining God as He was from
eternity, became man, what He was not before.</p>

<p> That such is the meaning of the above words is clear from the
Creed of the Holy Council of Constantinople, which says: Who for
us men, and for our salvation,, came down from heaven, and became
incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.
The same truth we also find unfolded by St. John the Evangelist,
who imbibed from the bosom of the Lord and Saviour Himself the
knowledge of this most profound mystery. For when he had declared
the nature of the Divine Word as follows: In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, he
concluded: And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.</p>

<p> The Word, which is a Person of the Divine Nature, assumed
human nature in such a manner that there should be one and the
same Person in both the divine and human natures. Hence this
admirable union preserved the actions and properties of both
natures; and as Pope St. Leo the Great said: The lowliness of the
inferior nature was not consumed in the glory of the superior,
nor did the assumption of the inferior lessen the glory of the
superior. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;By the Holy Ghost&quot;</h3>

<p>As an explanation of the words in which this Article is
expressed is not to be omitted, the pastor should teach that when
we say that the Son of God was conceived by the power of the Holy
Ghost, we do not mean that this Person alone of the Holy Trinity
accomplished the mystery of the Incarnation. Although the Son
only assumed human nature, yet all the Persons of the Trinity,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, were authors of this
mystery.</p>

<p> It is a principle of Christian faith that whatever God does
outside Himself in creation is common to the Three Persons, and
that one neither does more than, nor acts without another. But
that one emanates from another, this only cannot be common to
all; for the Son is begotten of the Father only, and the Holy
Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son. Anything, however,
which proceeds from them extrinsically is the work of the Three
Persons without difference of any sort, and of this latter
description is the Incarnation of the Son of God.</p>

<p> Of those things, nevertheless, that are common to all, the
Sacred ScripturesÂ­often attribute some to one person, some to
another. Thus, to the Father they attribute power over all things
; to the Son, wisdom; to the Holy Ghost, love. Hence, as the
mystery of the Incarnation manifests the singular and boundless
love of God towards us, it is therefore in some sort peculiarly
attributed to the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>In The Incarnation Some Things Were Natural, Others
Supernatural</h6>

<p> In this mystery we perceive that some things were done which
transcend the order of nature, some by the power of nature. Thus,
in believing that the body of Christ was formed from the most
pure blood of His Virgin Mother we acknowledge the operation of
human nature, this being a law common to the formation of all
human bodies, that they should be formed from the blood of the
mother.</p>

<p> But what surpasses the order of nature and human
comprehension is, that as soon as the Blessed Virgin assented to
the announcement of the Angel in these words, Behold the handmaid
of the Lord; be it done unto me according to thy word, the most
sacred body of Christ was immediately formed, and to it was
united a rational soul enjoying the use of reason; and thus in
the same instant of time He was perfect God and perfect man. That
this was the astonishing and admirable work of the Holy Ghost
cannot be doubted; for according to the order of nature the
rational soul is united to the body only after a certain lapse of
time. </p>

<p> Again -- and this should overwhelm us with astonishment -- as
soon as the soul of Christ was united to His body, the Divinity
became united to both; and thus at the same time His body was
formed and animated, and the Divinity united to body and soul. </p>

<p> Hence, at the same instant He was perfect God and perfect
man, and the most Holy Virgin, having at the same moment
conceived God and man, is truly and properly called Mother of God
and man. This the Angel signified to her when he said: Behold
thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and
thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be
called the Son of the Most High. The event verified the prophecy
of Isaias: Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.
Elizabeth also declared the same truth when&quot; being filled
with the Holy Ghost, she understood the Conception of the Son of
God, and said: Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord
should come to me?</p>

<p> As the body of Christ was formed of the pure blood of the
immaculate Virgin without the aid of man, as we have already
said, and by the sole operation of the Holy Ghost, so also, at
the moment of His Conception, His soul was enriched with an
overflowing fullness of the Spirit of God, and a superabundance
of all graces. For God gave not to Him, as to others adorned with
holiness and grace, His Spirit by measure, as St. John testifies
but poured into His soul the plenitude of all graces so
abundantly that of his fullness we all have received.</p>

<p> Although possessing that Spirit by which holy men attain the
adoption of sons of God, He cannot, however, be called the
adopted son of God; for since He is the Son of God by nature, the
grace, or name of adoption, can on no account be deemed
applicable to Him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>How To Profit By The Mystery Of The Incarnation </h6>

<p> These truths comprise the substance of what appears to demand
explanation regarding the admirable mystery of the Conception. To
reap from them abundant fruit for salvation the faithful should
particularly recall, and frequently reflect, that it is God who
assumed human flesh; that the manner in which He became man
exceeds our comprehension, not to say our powers of expression;
and finally, that He vouchsafed to become man in order that we
men might be born again as children of God. When to these
subjects they shall have given mature consideration, let them, in
the humility of faith, believe and adore all the mysteries
contained in this Article, and not indulge a curious
inquisitiveness by investigating and scrutinising them -- an
attempt scarcely ever unattended with danger.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part Of This Article: &quot;Born Of The Virgin
Mary&quot;</h3>

<p>These words comprise another part of this Article. In its
exposition the pastor should exercise considerable diligence,
because the faithful are bound to believe that Jesus the Lord was
not only conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, but was also
born of the Virgin Mary. The words of the Angel who first
announced the happy tidings to the world declare with what joy
and delight of soul this mystery of our faith should be meditated
upon. Behold, said the Angel, I bring you good tidings of great
joy&quot; that shall be to all the people. The same sentiments
are clearly conveyed in the song chanted by the heavenly host:
Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good
will. Then began the fulfilment of the splendid promise made by
God to Abraham&quot; that in his seed all the nations of the
earth should one day be blessed; for Mary&quot; whom we truly
proclaim and venerate as Mother of God, because she brought forth
Him who is at once God and man, was descended from King David.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Nativity Of Christ Transcends The Order Of Nature</h3>

<p>But as the Conception itself transcends the order of nature,
so also the birth of our Lord presents to our contemplation
nothing but what is divine.</p>

<p> Besides, what is admirable beyond the power of thoughts or
words to express, He is born of His Mother without any diminution
of her maternal virginity, just as He afterwards went forth from
the sepulchre while it was closed and sealed, and entered the
room in which His disciples were assembled, the doors being shut;
or, not to depart from everyÂ­day examples, just as the rays of
the sun penetrate without breaking or injuring in the least the
solid substance of glass, so after a like but more exalted manner
did Jesus Christ come forth from His mother's womb without injury
to her maternal virginity. This immaculate and perpetual
virginity forms, therefore, the just theme of our eulogy. Such
was the work of the Holy Ghost, who at the Conception and birth
of the Son so favoured the Virgin Mother as to impart to her
fecundity while preserving inviolate her perpetual virginity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ Compared to Adam&quot; Mary to Eve</h3>

<p>The Apostle sometimes calls Jesus Christ the second Adam, and
compares Him to the first Adam; for as in the first all men die,
so in the second all are made alive: and as in the natural order
Adam was the father of the human race, so in the supernatural
order Christ is The author of grace and of glory. </p>

<p> The Virgin Mother we may also compare to Eve, making the
second Eve, that is, Mary, correspond to the first, as we have
already shown that the second Adam, that is, Christ, corresponds
to the first Adam. By believing the serpent, Eve brought
malediction and death on mankind, and Mary, by believing the
Angel, became the instrument of The divine goodness in bringing
life and benediction to the human race. From Eve we are born
children of wrath; from Mary we have received Jesus Christ, and
through Him are regenerated children of grace. To Eve it was
said: In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children. Mary was exempt
from this law, for preserving her virginal integrity inviolate
she brought forth Jesus the Son of God without experiencing, as
we have already said, any sense of pain.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Types and Prophecies of the Conception and Nativity </h3>

<p>The mysteries of this admirable Conception and Nativity being,
therefore, so great and so numerous, it accorded with the plan of
divine Providence to signify them by many types and prophecies.
Hence the holy Fathers understood many things which we meet in
the Sacred Scriptures to refer to these mysteries, particularly
that gate of the sanctuary which Ezechiel saw closed; the stone
cut out of the mountain without hands, which became a great
mountain and filled the universe, of which we read in Daniel; the
rod of Aaron, which alone budded of all the rods of the princes
of Israel; and the bush which Moses saw burr without being
consumed.'</p>

<p> The holy Evangelist describes in detail the history of the
birth of Christ; but, as the pastor can easily recur to the
Sacred Volume, it is unnecessary for us to say more on the
subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Lessons which this Article Teaches</h3>

<p>The pastor should labor to impress deeply on the minds and
hearts of the faithful these mysteries, which were written for
our learning; first, that by the commemoration of so great a
benefit they may make some return of gratitude to God, its
author, and next, in order to place before their eyes, as a model
for imitation, this striking and singular example of humility.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Humility And Poverty Of Christ</h6>

<p> What can be more useful, what better calculated to subdue the
pride and haughtiness of the human heart, than to reflect
frequently that God humbles Himself in such a manner as to assume
our frailty and weakness, in order to communicate to us His
glory; that God becomes man, and that He at whose nod, to use the
words of Scripture, the pillars of heaven tremble and are
affrighted bows His supreme and infinite majesty to minister to
man; that He whom the Angels adore in heaven is born on earth !
When such is the goodness of God towards us, what, I ask, should
we not do to testify our obedience to His will? With what
willingness and alacrity should we not love, embrace, and perform
all the duties of humility ?</p>

<p> The faithful should also consider the salutary lessons which
Christ at His birth teaches before He begins to speak. He is born
in poverty; He is born a stranger under a roof not His own; He is
born in a lonely crib; He is born in the depth of winter ! For
St. Luke writes as follows: And it came to pass, that when they
were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be
delivered. And she brought forth her firstÂ­born, and wrapped him
up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there
was no room for them in the inn. Could the Evangelist have
described under more humble terms the majesty and glory that
filled the heavens and the earth ? He does not say, there was no
room in the inn, but there was no room for him who says, the
world is mine, and the fullness thereof. As another Evangelist
has expressed it: He came unto his own, and his own received him
not.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Elevation And Dignity Of Man</h6>

<p> When the faithful have placed these things before their eyes,
let them also reflect that God condescended to assume the
lowliness and frailty of our flesh in order to exalt man to the
highest degree of dignity. This single reflection, that He who is
true and perfect God became man, supplies sufficient proof of the
exalted dignity conferred on the human race by the divine bounty;
since we may now glory that the Son of God is bone of our bone,
and flesh of our flesh, a privilege not given to Angels, for
nowhere, says the Apostle, doth he take hold of the Angels: but
of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Duty Of Spiritual Nativity</h6>

<p> We must also take care lest to our great injury it should
happen that just as there was no room for Him in the inn at
Bethlehem, in which to be born, so likewise now, after He has
been born in the flesh, He should find no room in our hearts in
which to be born spiritually. For since He is most desirous of
our salvation, this spiritual birth is the object of His most
earnest solicitude.</p>

<p> As, then, by the power of the Holy Ghost, and in a manner
superior to the order of nature, He was made man and was born,
was holy and even holiness itself, so does it become our duty to
be born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God;
to walk as new creatures in newness of spirit, and to preserve
that holiness and purity of soul which so much becomes men
regenerated by the Spirit of God. Thus shall we reflect some
faint image of the holy Conception and Nativity of the Son of
God, which are the objects of our firm faith, and believing which
we revere and adore the wisdom of God in a mystery which is
hidden. </p>
