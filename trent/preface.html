<h3><center>CATECHISM OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT FOR PARISH PRIESTS (Preface)</center></h3> 
<p><center>Issued by order of Pope Pius V</center></p>
<p></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<h3>The Necessity Of Religious Instruction</h3>

<p>Such is the nature of the human mind and intellect that,
although by means of diligent and laborious inquiry it has of
itself investigated and discovered many other things pertaining
to a knowledge of divine truths; yet guided by its natural lights
it never could have known or perceived most of those things by
which is attained eternal salvation, the principal end of man's
creation and formation to the image and likeness of God.</p>

<p> It is true that the invisible things of God from the creation
of the world are, as the Apostle teaches, clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made: his eternal power also,
and divinity. But the mystery which hath been hidden from ages
and generations so far transcends the reach of man's
understanding, that were it not made manifest by God to His
Saints, to whom He willed to make known by the gift of faith, the
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is
Christ, man could by no effort attain to such wisdom.</p>

<p> But, as faith comes by hearing, it is clear how necessary at
all times for the attainment of eternal salvation has been the
labour and faithful ministry of an authorised teacher; for it is
written, how shall they hear, without a preacher? And how shall
they preach unless they be sent?</p>

<p> And, indeed, never, from the very creation of the world, has
God, most merciful and benignant, been wanting to His own; but at
sundry times and in divers manners spoke to the fathers by the
prophets, and pointed out to them in a manner suited to the times
and circumstances, a sure and direct path to the happiness of
heaven. But, as He had foretold that He would give a teacher of
justice to be the light of the Gentiles, that His salvation might
reach even to the ends of the earth, in these last days he hath
spoken to us by his Son, whom also by a voice from heaven, from
the excellent glory, He has commanded all to hear and to obey.
Furthermore, the Son gave some to be apostles, and some prophets,
and others pastors and teachers, to announce the word of life;
that we might not be carried about like children tossed to and
fro with every wind of doctrine, but holding fast to the firm
foundation of the faith, we might be built together into an
habitation of God in the Spirit.</p>

<p> Lest any should receive the Word of God from the ministers of
the Church, not as the word of Christ, which it really is, but as
the word of man, the same Saviour has ordained that their
ministry should be invested with so great authority that He says
to them: He that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you
despises me. These words He spoke not only of those to whom His
words were addressed, but likewise of all who, by legitimate
succession, should discharge the ministry of the word, promising
to be with them all days even to the consummation of the world. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Need of an Authoritative Catholic Catechism</h3>

<p>But while the preaching of the divine Word should never be
interrupted in the Church, surely in these, our days, it becomes
necessary to labour with more than ordinary zeal and piety to
nourish and strengthen the faithful with sound and wholesome
doctrine, as with the food of life. For false prophets have gone
forth into the world, to corrupt the minds of the faithful with
various and strange doctrines, of whom the Lord has said: I did
not send prophets, yet they ran; I spoke not to them, yet they
prophesied.</p>

<p> In this work, to such extremes has their impiety, practiced
in all the arts of Satan, been carried, that it would seem almost
impossible to confine it within any bounds; and did we not rely
on the splendid promises of the Saviour, who declared that He had
built His Church on so solid a foundation that the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it, we should have good reason to fear
lest, beset on every side by such a host of enemies and assailed
and attacked by so many machinations, it would, in these days,
fall to the ground.</p>

<p> For ­ to say nothing of those illustrious States which
heretofore professed, in piety and holiness, the true Catholic
faith transmitted to them by their ancestors, but are now gone
astray wandering from the paths of truth and openly declaring
that their best claims to piety are founded on a total
abandonment of the faith of their fathers ­ there is no region,
however remote, no place, however securely guarded, no corner of
Christendom, into which this pestilence has not sought secretly
to insinuate itself.</p>

<p> For those who intended to corrupt the minds of the faithful,
knowing that they could not hold immediate personal intercourse
with all, and thus pour into their ears their poisoned doctrines,
adopted another plan which enabled them to disseminate error and
impiety more easily and extensively. Besides those voluminous
works by which they sought the subversion of the Catholic faith
­ to guard against which (volumes) required perhaps little
labour or circumspection, since their contents were clearly
heretical ­ they also composed innumerable smaller books, which,
veiling their errors under the semblance of piety, deceived with
incredible facility the unsuspecting minds of simple folk.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Nature of this Work</h3>

<p>The Fathers, therefore, of the General Council of Trent,
anxious to apply some healing remedy to so great and pernicious
an evil, were not satisfied with having decided the more
important points of Catholic doctrine against the heresies of our
times, but deemed it further necessary to issue, for the
instruction of the faithful in the very rudiments of faith, a
form and method to be followed in all churches by those to whom
are lawfully entrusted the duties of pastor and teacher.</p>

<p> To works of this kind many, it is true, had already given
their attention, and earned the reputation of great piety and
learning. But the Fathers deemed it of the first importance that
a work should appear, sanctioned by the authority of the Council,
from which pastors and all others on whom the duty of imparting
instruction devolves, may be able to seek and find reliable
matter for the edification of the faithful; that, as there is one
Lord, one faith, there may also be one standard and prescribed
form of propounding the dogmas of faith, and instructing
Christians in all the duties of piety.</p>

<p> As, therefore, the design of the work embraces a variety of
matters, it cannot be supposed that the Council intended that in
one volume all the dogmas of Christianity should be explained
with that minuteness of detail to be found in the works of those
who profess to treat the teaching and doctrines of religion in
their entirety. Such a task would be one of almost endless
labour, and manifestly ill suited to attain the proposed end.
But, having undertaken to instruct pastors and such as have care
of souls in those things that belong peculiarly to the pastoral
office and are accommodated to the capacity of the faithful, the
Council intended that such things only should be treated of as
might assist the pious zeal of pastors in discharging the duty of
instruction, should they not be very familiar with the more
abstruse questions of theology.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ends of Religious Instruction</h3>

<p>Hence, before we proceed to develop in detail the various
parts of this summary of doctrine, our purpose requires that we
premise a few observations which the pastor should consider and
bear in mind in order to know to what end, as it were, all his
plans and labours and efforts are to be directed, and how this
desired end may be more easily attained.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Knowledge Of Christ</h3>

<p>The first thing is ever to recollect that all Christian
knowledge is reduced to one single head, or rather, to use the
words of the Apostle, this is eternal life: That they may know
thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. A
teacher in the Church should, therefore, use his best endeavours
that the faithful earnestly desire to know Jesus Christ, and him
crucified, that they be firmly convinced, and with the most
heartfelt piety and devotion believe, that there is no other name
under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved, for he is
the propitiation for our sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Observance Of The Commandments</h3>

<p>But since by this we know that we have known him, if we keep
his commandments, the next consideration, and one intimately
connected with the preceding, is to press also upon the attention
of the faithful that their lives are not to be wasted in ease and
indolence, but that we are to walk even as he walked, and pursue
with all earnestness, justice, godliness, faith, charity,
patience, mildness; for He gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a
people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. These things the
Apostle commands pastors to speak and exhort.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Love Of God</h3>

<p>But as our Lord and Saviour has not only declared, but has
also proved by His own example, that the Law and the Prophets
depend on love, and as, according to the Apostle, charity is the
end of the commandment, and the fulfilment of the law, it is
unquestionably a chief duty of the pastor to use the utmost
diligence to excite the faithful to a love of the infinite
goodness of God towards us, that, burning with a sort of divine
ardour, they may be powerfully attracted to the supreme and
all­perfect good, to adhere to which is true and solid
happiness, as is fully experienced by him who can say with the
Prophet: What have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire
upon earth?</p>

<p> This, assuredly, is that more excellent way pointed out by
the Apostle when he sums up all his doctrines and instructions in
charity, which never falleth away. For whatever is proposed by
the pastor, whether it be the exercise of faith, of hope, or of
some moral virtue, the love of our Lord should at the same time
be so strongly insisted upon as to show clearly that all the
works of perfect Christian virtue can have no other origin, no
other end than divine love.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Means Required for Religious Instruction </h3>

<p>But as in imparting instruction of any sort the manner of
communicating it is of highest importance, so in conveying
religious instruction to the people, the method should be deemed
of the greatest moment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Instruction Should Be Accommodated To The Capacity Of
The Hearer</h3>

<p>Age, capacity, manners and condition must be borne in mind, so
that he who instructs may become all things to all men, in order
that he may be able to gain all to Christ, prove himself a
dutiful minister and steward, and, like a good and faithful
servant, be found worthy to be placed by his Lord over many
things The priest must not imagine that those committed to his
care are all on the same level, so that he can follow one fixed
and unvarying method of instruction to lead all in the same way
to knowledge and true piety; for some are as new­born infants,
others are growing up in Christ, while a few are, so to say, of
full maturity. Hence the necessity of considering who they are
that have occasion for milk, who for more solid food, and of
affording to each such nourishment of doctrine as may give
spiritual increase, until we all meet in the unity of faith, and
of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the age of the fullness of Christ. This the Apostle
inculcates for all by his own example when he says that he is a
debtor to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to
the unwise, thus giving all who are called to this ministry to
understand that in announcing the mysteries of faith and the
precepts of life, the instruction is to be so accommodated to the
capacity and intelligence of the hearers, that, while the minds
of the strong are filled with spiritual food, the little ones be
not suffered to perish with hunger, asking for bread, while there
is none to break it unto them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Zeal</h3>

<p>Nor should our zeal in communicating Christian knowledge be
relaxed because it has sometimes to be exercised in expounding
matters apparently humble and unimportant, and whose exposition
is usually irksome, especially to minds accustomed to the
contemplation of the more sublime truths of religion. If the
Wisdom of the eternal Father descended upon the earth in the
meanness of our flesh to teach us the maxims of a heavenly life,
who is there whom the love of Christ does not constrain to become
little in the midst of his brethren, and, as a nurse fostering
her children, so anxiously to wish for the salvation of his
neighbours as to be ready, as the Apostle says of himself, to
give them not only the gospel of God, but even his own life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Study Of The Word Of God</h3>

<p>Now all the doctrines in which the faithful are to be
instructed are contained in the Word of God, which is found in
Scripture and tradition. To the study of these, therefore, the
pastor should devote his days and his nights, keeping in mind the
admonition of St. Paul to Timothy, which all who have the care of
souls should consider as addressed to themselves: Attend to
reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine, for all Scripture
divinely inspired is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct,
to instruct injustice, that the man of God may be perfect,
furnished to every good work.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Division of this Catechism</h3>

<p>The truths revealed by Almighty God are so many and so various
that it is no easy task to acquire a knowledge of them, or,
having done so, to remember them so well as to be able to explain
them with ease and readiness when occasion requires. Hence our
predecessors in the faith have very wisely reduced all the
doctrines of salvation to these four heads: The Apostles' Creed,
the Sacraments, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer.</p>

<p> The part on the Creed contains all that is to be held
according to Christian faith, whether it regard the knowledge of
God, the creation and government of the world, or the redemption
of man, the rewards of the good and the punishments of the
wicked. The part devoted to the Seven Sacraments teaches us what
are the signs, and, as it were, the instruments of grace. In the
part on the Decalogue is described whatever has reference to the
law, whose end is charity. Finally, the Lord's Prayer contains
whatever can be the object of the Christian's desires, or hopes,
or prayers. The exposition, therefore, of these four parts, which
are, as it were, the general heads of Sacred Scripture, includes
almost everything that a Christian should learn.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How This Work Is To Be Used</h3>

<p>We therefore deem it proper to inform pastors that, whenever
they have occasion, in the ordinary discharge of their duty, to
expound any passage of the Gospel or any other part of Holy
Scripture. they will find its subject­matter treated under some
one of the four heads already enumerated, to which they recur, as
to the source from which their instruction is to be drawn.</p>

<p> Thus, if the Gospel of the first Sunday of Advent is to be
explained, There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,
etc., whatever regards its explanation is contained under the
Article of the Creed, He shall come to judge the living and the
dead; and by embodying the substance of that Article in his
exposition, the pastor will at once instruct his people in the
Creed and in the Gospel. Whenever, therefore, he has to
communicate instruction and expound the Scriptures, he will
observe the same rule of referring all to these four principal
heads under which, as we observed, the whole teaching and
doctrine of Holy Scripture is contained. As for order, however,
he is free to follow that which he deems best suited to the
circumstances of persons and time.</p>
