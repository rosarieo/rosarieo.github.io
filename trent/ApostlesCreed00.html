<title> THE CATECHISM OF TRENT: The Creed -- Introduction</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>Faith</h3>

<p>In preparing and instructing men in the teachings of Christ
the Lord, the Fathers began by explaining the meaning of faith.
Following their example, we have thought it well to treat first
what pertains to that virtue.</p>

<p> Though the word faith has a variety of meanings in the Sacred
Scriptures, we here speak only of that faith by which we yield
our entire assent to whatever has been divinely revealed. </p>

<h3>Necessity Of Faith</h3>

<p>That faith thus understood is necessary to salvation no man
can reasonably doubt, particularly since it is written: Without
faith it is impossible to please God. For as the end proposed to
man as his ultimate happiness is far above the reach of human
understanding, it was therefore necessary that it should be made
known to him by God. This knowledge, however, is nothing else
than faith, by which we yield our unhesitating assent to whatever
the authority of our Holy Mother the Church teaches us to have
been revealed by God; for the faithful cannot doubt those things
of which God, who is truth itself, is the author. Hence we see
the great difference that exists between this faith which we give
to God and that which we yield to the writers of human history. </p>

<h3>Unity Of Faith</h3>

<p>Faith differs in degree; for we read in Scripture these words:
O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt; and Great is thy
faith; and Increase our faith. It also differs in dignity, for we
read: Faith without works is dead; and, Faith that worketh by
charity. But although faith is so comprehensive, it is yet the
same in kind, and the full force of its definition applies
equally to all its varieties. How fruitful it is and how great
are the advantages we may derive from it we shall point out when
explaining the Articles of the Creed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name="creed"></a>The Creed</h3>

<p>Now the chief truths which Christians ought to hold are those
which the holy Apostles, the leaders and teachers of the faith,
inspired by the Holy Ghost' have divided into the twelve Articles
of the Creed. For having received a command from the Lord to go
forth into the whole world, as His ambassadors, and preach the
Gospel to every creature, they thought it advisable to draw up a
formula of Christian faith, that all might think and speak the
same thing, and that among those whom they should have called to
the unity of the faith no schisms would exist, but that they
should be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment. </p>

<p>This profession of Christian faith and hope, drawn up by
themselves, the Apostles called a symbol; either because it was
made up of various parts, each of which was contributed by an
Apostle, or because by it, as by a common sign and watchword,
they might easily distinguish deserters from the faith and false
brethren unawares brought in, adulterating the word of God, from
those who had truly bound themselves by oath to serve under the
banner of Christ. </p>

<h3>Division Of The Creed</h3>

<p>Christianity proposes to the faithful many truths which,
either separately or in general, must be held with an assured and
firm faith. Among these what must first and necessarily be
believed by all is that which God Himself has taught us as the
foundation and summary of truth concerning the unity of the
Divine Essence, the distinction of Three Persons, and the actions
which are peculiarly attributed to each. The pastor should teach
that the Apostles, Creed briefly comprehends the doctrine of this
mystery. </p>

<p>For, as has been observed by our predecessors in the faith,
who have treated this subject with great piety and accuracy, the
Creed seems to be divided into three principal parts: one
describing the First Person of the Divine Nature, and the
stupendous work of the creation; another, the Second Person, and
the mystery of man's redemption; a third, the Third Person, the
head and source of our sanctification; the whole being expressed
in various and most appropriate propositions. These propositions
are called Articles, from a comparison frequently used by the
Fathers; for as the members of the body are divided by joints
(articuli), so in this profession of faith, whatever is to be
believed distinctly and separately from anything else is rightly
and suitably called an Article. </p>
