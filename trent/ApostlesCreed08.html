<h3><center>ARTICLE VIII : &quot;I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY
GHOST&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>Hitherto we have expounded, as far as the nature of the
subject seemed to require, what pertains to the First and Second
Per sons of the Holy Trinity. It now remains to explain what the
Creed contains with regard to the Third Person, the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> On this subject the pastor should omit nothing that study and
industry can effect; for on this Article, no less than on those
that preceded, ignorance or error would be unpardonable in a
Christian. Hence, the Apostle did not permit some among the
Ephesians to remain in ignorance with regard to the Person of the
Holy Ghost. Having asked if they had received the Holy Ghost, and
having received for answer that they did not so much as know that
there was a Holy, Ghost, he at once demanded: In whom, therefore,
were you baptised? to signify that a distinct knowledge of this
Article is most necessary to the faithful.</p>

<p> From such knowledge they derive special fruit. For,
considering attentively that whatever they have, they possess
through the bounty and beneficence of the Holy Spirit, they begin
to think more modestly and humbly of themselves, and to place all
their hopes in the protection of God, which for a Christian is
the first step towards consummate wisdom and supreme happiness. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Holy Ghost&quot;</h3>

<p>The exposition of this Article, therefore, should begin with
the force and meaning here attached to the words Holy Ghost. This
appellation is equally true when applied to the Father and the
Son, since both are spirit, both holy, and we confess that God is
a Spirit; this name may also be applied to Angels, and the souls
of the just. Care must be taken, therefore, that the faithful be
not led into error by the ambiguity of the words. </p>

<p> The pastor, then, should teach that by the words Holy Ghost
in this Article is understood the Third Person of the Blessed
Trinity, a sense in which they are used, sometimes in the Old,
and frequently in the New Testament. Thus David prays: Take not
thy Holy Spirit from me; and in the Book of Wisdom we read: Who
shall know thy thoughts, except thou give wisdom, and send thy
Holy Spirit from above? And in another place it is said: He
created her in the Holy Ghost.' We are also commanded, in the New
Testament to be baptised in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. We read that the most holy Virgin
conceived of the Holy Ghost; and we are sent by St. John to
Christ, who baptizeth us in the Holy Ghost.' There are many other
passages in which the words Holy Ghost occur.</p>

<p> No one should be surprised that a proper name is not given to
the Third, as to the First and Second Persons. The Second Person
is designated by a proper name, and called Son, because, as has
been explained in the preceding Articles, His eternal birth from
the Father is properly called generation. As, therefore, that
birth is expressed by the word generation, so the Person,
emanating from that generation, is properly called Son, and the
Person, from whom he emanates, Father.</p>

<p> But as the production of the Third Person has no proper name,
but is called spiration and procession, the Person produced is,
consequently, designated by no proper name. His emanation has no
proper name simply because we are obliged to borrow from created
objects the names given to God and know no other created means of
communicating nature and essence than that of generation. Hence
we cannot discover a proper name to express the manner in which
God communicates Himself entire, by the force of His love.
Wherefore we call the Third Person Holy Ghost, a name, however,
peculiarly appropriate to Him who infuses into us spiritual life,
and without whose holy inspiration we can do nothing meritorious
of eternal life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;I Believe in the Holy Ghost&quot;</h3>

<h3>The Holy Ghost Is Equal To The Father And The Son</h3>

<p>The people, when once acquainted with the meaning of His name,
should first of all be taught that the Holy Ghost is equally God
with the Father and the Son, equally omnipotent and eternal,
infinitely perfect, the supreme good, infinitely wise, and of the
same nature as the Father and the Son.</p>

<p> All this is obviously enough implied by the force of the word
in, when we say: I believe in the Holy Ghost; for this
preposition is prefixed to each Person of the Trinity in order to
express the exact nature of our faith.</p>

<p> The Divinity of the Holy Ghost is also clearly established by
many passages of Scripture. When, in the Acts of the Apostles,
St. Peter says, Ananias, Why hast thou conceived this thing in
thy heart? he immediately adds: Thou hast not lied to men, but to
God, calling Him God to whom he had just before given the name
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> The Apostle, also, writing to the Corinthians, interprets
what he says of God as said of the Holy Ghost. There are, he
says, diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh
all in all; but, he continues, all these things one and the same
Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</p>

<p> In the Acts of the Apostles also what the Prophets attribute
to God alone, St. Paul ascribes to the Holy. Ghost. Thus Isaias
had said: I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I
send? . . . And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people:
Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and
shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with
their ears. Having cited these words, the Apostle adds: Well did
the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers, by Isaias the prophet.</p>

<p> Again, the Sacred Scriptures join the Person of the Holy
Ghost to those of the Father and the Son, as, for example, when
Baptism is commanded to be administered in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. There is thus no
room left us of doubting the truth of this mystery. For if the
Father is God, and the Son God, we must admit that the Holy
Ghost, who is united with Them in the same degree of honour, is
also God.</p>

<p> Besides, baptism administered in the name of any creature can
be of no effect. Were you baptised in the name of Paul? says the
Apostle, to show that such baptism could have availed nothing to
salvation. Since, therefore, we are baptised in the name of the
Holy Ghost, we must acknowledge the Holy Ghost to be God. </p>

<p> This same order of the Three Persons, which proves the
Divinity of the Holy Ghost, is also found in the Epistle of St.
John: There are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father,
the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one; and also
in that noble eulogy of the Holy Trinity, with which the Divine
Praises and the Psalms are concluded: Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> Finally, what most strongly confirms this truth is the fact
that Holy Scripture assigns to the Holy Ghost whatever attributes
we believe proper to God. Wherefore to Him is ascribed the honour
of temples, as when the Apostle says: Know you not that your
members are the temple of the Holy Ghost? Scripture also
attributes to Him the power to sanctify, to vivify, to search the
depths of God, to speak by the Prophets, and to be present in all
places, all of which can be attributed to God alone.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Holy Ghost Is Distinct From The Father And The
Son</h3>

<p>The pastor should also accurately explain to the faithful that
the Holy Ghost is not only God, but that we must also confess
that He is the Third Person of the Divine Nature, distinct from
the Father and the Son, and produced by Their will. </p>

<p> To say nothing of other testimonies of Scripture, the form of
Baptism, taught by our Redeemer,' shows most clearly that the
Holy Ghost is the Third Person, selfÂ­existent in the Divine
Nature and distinct from the other Persons. It is a doctrine
taught also by the Apostle when he says: The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of
the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</p>

<p> This same truth is still more explicitly declared in these
words added to this Article of the Creed by the Fathers of the
First Council of Constantinople to refute the impious folly of
Macedonius: And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life,
who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son; who together with
the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified; who spoke by the
prophets.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;The Lord&quot;</h3>

<p>By confessing the Holy Ghost to be Lord they declare how far
He excels the Angels, who are the noblest spirits created by God;
for they are all, says the Apostle, ministering spirits, sent to
minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation.
</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;LifeÂ­Giver&quot;</h3>

<p>They also designate the Holy Ghost the giver of life because
the soul lives more by its union with God than the body is
nourished and sustained by its union with the soul. Since then,
the Sacred Scriptures ascribe to the Holy Ghost this union of the
soul with God, it is clear that He is most rightly called the
giver of life. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Who Proceedeth from the Father and the
Son&quot;</h3>

<p>With regard to the words immediately succeeding: who
proceedeth from the Father and the Son, the faithful are to be
taught that the Holy Ghost proceeds by an eternal procession from
the Father and the Son, as from one principle. This truth is
proposed for our belief by the Creed of the Church, from which no
Christian may depart, and is confirmed by the authority of the
Sacred Scriptures and of Councils.</p>

<p> Christ the Lord, speaking of the Holy Ghost, says: He shall
glorify me, because he shall receive of mine. We also find that
the Holy Ghost is sometimes called in Scripture the Spirit of
Christ, sometimes, the Spirit of the Father; that He is one time
said to be sent by the Father, another time, by the Son, -- all
of which clearly signifies that He proceeds alike from the Father
and the Son. He, says St. Paul, who has not the Spirit of Christ
belongs not to him. In his Epistle to the Galatians he also calls
the Holy Ghost the Spirit of Christ: God hath sent the Spirit of
his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father. In the Gospel of
St. Matthew, He is called the Spirit of the Father: It is not you
that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</p>

<p> Our Lord said, at His Last Supper: When the Paraclete cometh
whom I will send you, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from
the Father, he shall give testimony of me. On another occasion,
that the Holy Ghost will be sent by the Father, He declares in
these words: whom the Father will send in my name. Understanding
these words to denote the procession of the Holy Ghost, we come
to the inevitable conclusion that He proceeds from both Father
and Son. </p>

<p> The above are the truths that should be taught with regard to
the Person of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Certain Divine Works are Appropriated to the Holy
Ghost</h3>

<p>It is also the duty of the pastor to teach that there are
certain admirable effects, certain excellent gifts of the Holy
Ghost, which are said to originate and emanate from Him, as from
a perennial fountain of goodness. Although the intrinsic works of
the most Holy Trinity are common to the Three Persons, yet many
of them are attributed specially to the Holy Ghost, to signify
that they arise from the boundless charity of God towards us. For
as the Holy Ghost proceeds from the divine will, inflamed, as it
were, with love, we can perceive that these effects which are
referred particularly to the Holy Ghost, are the result of God's
supreme love for us.</p>

<p> Hence it is that the Holy Ghost is called a gift; for by the
word gift we understand that which is kindly and gratuitously
bestowed, without expectation of any return. Whatever gifts and
graces, therefore, have been conferred on us by God -- and what
have we, says the Apostle, that we have not received from God? --
we should piously and gratefully acknowledge as bestowed by the
grace and gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Creation, Government, Life</h3>

<p>These gifts of the Holy Ghost are numerous. Not to mention the
creation of the world, the propagation and government of all
created beings, discussed in the first Article, we have just
shown that the giving of life is particularly attributed to the
Holy Ghost, and this is further confirmed by the testimony of
Ezechiel: I will give you spirit and you shall live.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Seven Gifts</h3>

<p>The Prophet (Isaias), however, enumerates the chief effects
which are most properly ascribed to the Holy Ghost: The spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and fortitude,
the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of
the Lord. These effects are called the gifts of the Holy Ghost,
and sometimes they are even called the Holy Ghost. Wisely,
therefore, does St. Augustine admonish us, whenever we meet the
word Holy Ghost in Scripture, to distinguish whether it means the
Third Person of the Trinity or His gifts and operations.Â­' The
two are as far apart as the Creator is from the creature. </p>

<p> The diligence of the pastor in expounding these truths should
be the greater, since it is from these gifts of the Holy Ghost
that we derive rules of Christian life and are enabled to know if
the Holy Ghost dwells within us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Justifying Grace</h3>

<p>But the grace of justification, which signs us with the Holy
Spirit of promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance,'
transcends all His other most ample gifts. It unites us to God in
the closest bonds of love, lights up within us the sacred flame
of piety, forms us to newness of life, renders us partakers of
the divine nature, and enables us to be called and really to be
the sons of God.</p>
