<h3><center>THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION</center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On Confirmation</h3>

<p>If ever there was a time demanding the diligence of pastors in
explaining the Sacrament of Confirmation, in these days certainly
it requires special attention, when there are found in the holy
Church of God many by whom this Sacrament is altogether omitted;
while very few seek to obtain from it the fruit of divine grace
which they should derive from its participation.</p>

<p> Lest, therefore, this divine blessing may seem, through their
fault, and to their most serious injury, to have been conferred
on them in vain, the faithful are to be instructed both on
Whitsunday, on which day it is principally administered, and also
on such other days as pastors shall deem convenient. Their
instructions should so treat the nature, power, and dignity of
this Sacrament, that the faithful may understand not only that it
is not to be neglected, hut that it is to be received with the
greatest piety and devotion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Name of this Sacrament</h3>

<p>To begin with the name, it should be taught that this
Sacrament is called by the Church Confirmation because, if there
is no obstacle to the efficacy of the Sacrament, a baptised
person, when anointed with the sacred chrism by the Bishop, with
the accompanying solemn words: I sign thee with the sign of the
cross, and confirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, becomes
stronger with the strength of a new power, and thus begins to be
a perfect soldier of Christ. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Confirmation is a Sacrament</h3>

<p>That in Confirmation is contained the true and proper nature
of a Sacrament has always been acknowledged by the Catholic
Church, as Pope Melchiades and many other very holy and very
ancient Pontiffs expressly declare. The truth of this doctrine
St. Clement could not confirm in stronger terms than when he
says: All should hasten without delay to be born again unto God,
and afterwards to be signed by the Bishop, that is, to receive
the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost; for, as has been handed
down to us from St. Peter, and as the other Apostles taught in
obedience to the command and of our Lord, he who culpably and
voluntarily, and not from necessity, neglects to receive this
Sacrament, cannot possibly be a perfect Christian. This same
faith has been confirmed, as may be seen in their decrees, by
Popes Urban, Fabian and Eusebius, who, filled with the same
spirit, shed their blood for the name of Christ.</p>

<p> The unanimous authority of the Fathers must be added. Among
them Denis the Areopagite, Bishop of Athens, when teaching how to
consecrate and make use of this holy ointment, says: The priests
clothe the person Baptised with a garment emblematic of purity,
in order to conduct him to the Bishop; and the Bishop, signing
him with the sacred and truly divine ointment, makes him partaker
of the most holy communion. Of such importance does Eusebius of
Caesarea also deem this Sacrament as not to hesitate to say that
the heretic Novatus could not deserve to receive the Holy Ghost,
because, having been baptised in a state of severe illness, he
was not anointed with the sign of chrism. But on this subject we
have the most distinct testimonies from St. Ambrose in his book
On the Initiated, and from St. Augustine in his books Against the
Epistles of Petilian the Donatist.</p>

<p> Both of them were so persuaded that no doubt could exist as
to the reality of this Sacrament that they even taught and
confirmed the doctrine by passages of Scripture, the one
testifying that to the Sacrament of Confirmation apply these
words of the Apostle: Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby
you are sealed; the other, these words of the Psalmist: Like the
precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the
beard of Aaron, and also these words of the same Apostle: The
charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
who is given to us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Confirmation is Distinct from Baptism</h3>

<p>Although said by Melchiades to have a most intimate connection
with Baptism, Confirmation is still not to be regarded as the
same, but as a very different Sacrament; for the variety of the
grace which each of the Sacraments confers, and of the sensible
sign employed to signify that grace, evidently render them
distinct and different Sacraments.</p>

<p> Since, then, by the grace of Baptism we are begotten unto
newness of life, whereas by that of Confirmation we grow to full
maturity, having put away the things of a child, we can
sufficiently understand that the same difference that exists in
the natural life between birth and growth exists also between
Baptism, which regenerates, and Confirmation, by virtue of which
growth and perfect spiritual strength are imparted to the
faithful. </p>

<p> Besides, as there should be a new and distinct kind of
Sacrament when the soul has to encounter any new difficulty, it
may easily be perceived that as we require the grace of Baptism
to form the mind unto faith, so is it also of the utmost
advantage that the souls of the faithful be strengthened by a
different grace, to the end that they be deterred by no danger,
or fear of pains, tortures or death, from the confession of the
true faith. This, then, being accomplished by the sacred chrism
of Confirmation, it is hence clearly inferred, that the nature of
this Sacrament is different from Baptism.</p>

<p> Hence Pope Melchiades accurately evolves the difference
between them, writing as follows: In Baptism man is enlisted into
the service, in Confirmation he is equipped for battle; at the
baptismal font the Holy Ghost imparts fullness to accomplish
innocence, but in Confirmation he ministers perfection to grace;
in Baptism we are regenerated unto life, after Baptism we are
fortified for the combat; in Baptism we are cleansed, after
Baptism we are strengthened; regeneration of itself saves those
who receive Baptism in time of peace, Confirmation arms and makes
ready for conflicts.</p>

<p> These are truths not only already recorded by other Councils,
but specially defined by the holy Council of Trent; so that we
are therefore no longer at liberty not only to think otherwise,
but even to entertain the least doubt concerning them. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Institution of Confirmation</h3>

<p>It was shown above how necessary it is to teach concerning all
the Sacraments in common from whom they had their origin.
Wherefore the same is also to be taught as regards Confirmation,
in order that the faithful may be impressed with a deeper sense
of the sanctity of this Sacrament. Accordingly, pastors must
explain that not only was it instituted by Christ the Lord, but
that by Him were also ordained, as Pope St. Fabian testifies, the
rite of chrism and the words which the Catholic Church uses in
its administration. This is a fact easy to prove to those who
acknowledge Confirmation to be a Sacrament, because all the
sacred mysteries exceed the powers of human nature and could be
instituted by no other than God alone.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Component Parts of Confirmation</h3>

<h3>The Matter</h3>

<p>We now come to treat of the component parts of the Sacrament,
and first of its matter. This is called chrism, a word borrowed
from the Greek language, and which, although used by profane
writers to designate any sort of ointment, is appropriated by
common usage among ecclesiastical writers to signify that
ointment only which is composed of oil and balsam with the solemn
consecration of the Bishop. A mixture of two material things,
therefore, furnishes the matter of Confirmation; and this mixture
of different things not only declares the manifold grace of the
Holy Ghost given to those who are confirmed but also sufficiently
shows the excellence of the Sacrament itself.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Remote Matter Of Confirmation Is Chrism</h3>

<p>That such is the matter of this Sacrament the holy Church and
her Councils have always taught; and the same doctrine has been
handed­down to us by St. Denis and by many other Fathers of the
gravest authority, particularly by Pope Fabian,' who testifies
that the Apostles received the composition of chrism from our
Lord and transmitted it to us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Appropriateness Of Chrism</h3>

<p>Nor indeed could any other matter than that of chrism seem
more appropriate to declare the effects of this Sacrament. Oil,
by its nature rich, unctuous and fluid, expresses the fullness of
grace, which, through the Holy Ghost, overflows and is poured
into others from Christ the head, like the ointment that ran down
upon the beard of Aaron, to the skirt of his garment; for God
anointed him with the oil of gladness, above his fellows, and of
his fullness we all have received.</p>

<p> Balsam, the door of which is most pleasant, can signify
nought save that the faithful, when made perfect by the grace of
Confirmation, diffuse around them such a sweet door of all
virtues, that they may say with the Apostle: We are unto God the
good odour of Christ. Balsam has also the power of preserving
from corruption whatever it is used to anoint. This property
seems admirably suited to express the virtue of the Sacrament,
since it is quite evident that the souls of the faithful,
prepared by the heavenly grace of Confirmation, are easily
protected from the contagion of sins. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Chrism To Be Consecrated By The Bishop</h3>

<p>The chrism is consecrated by the Bishop with solemn
ceremonies; for that our Saviour gave this instruction at His
last supper, when He committed to His Apostles the manner of
making chrism, we learn from Fabian, a pontiff eminently
distinguished by his sanctity and by the glory of martyrdom.</p>

<p> The necessity of this consecration may, however, be shown
from reason also. In most of the other Sacraments Christ so
instituted their matter as to impart holiness also to it. For not
only did He designate water as the element of Baptism, saying:
Except a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot
enter the kingdom of God; but He also, at His own Baptism,
imparted to it the power of sanctifying thereafter. Hence these
words of St. Chrysostom: The water of Baptism, had it not been
sanctified by contact with the body of our Lord, could not purge
away the sins of believers. As, then, our Lord did not consecrate
this matter of Confirmation by actually using and handling it, it
is necessary that it be consecrated by holy and religious
prayers; and this consecration can appertain to none save the
Bishop, who has been appointed the ordinary minister of this
Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Form Of Confirmation</h3>

<p>The other component part of Confirmation, that is, its form
and the words used at the sacred unction, must also be explained.
The faithful are to be admonished that in receiving this
Sacrament they are, in particular on hearing the words
pronounced, to excite their minds to piety, faith and religion,
that no obstacle may be placed to heavenly grace.</p>

<p> The form of Confirmation, then, is comprised in these words:
I sign thee with the sign of the cross, and I confirm thee with
the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. If we call upon reason regarding this
truth, we may also easily prove the same thing; for the form of a
Sacrament should comprise all those things that explain the
nature and substance of the Sacrament itself. But in Confirmation
these three things are chiefly to be noted: the divine power
which, as a principal cause, operates in the Sacrament; the
strength of mind and soul which is imparted by the sacred unction
to the faithful unto salvation; and finally, the sign impressed
on him who is to enter upon the warfare of Christ. Now of these
the first is sufficiently declared by the concluding words of the
form: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost; the second, by the words immediately preceding them: I
confirm thee with the chrism of salvation; and the third, by the
words with which the form opens: I sign thee with the sign of the
cross. </p>

<p> But were we even unable to prove by reason that this is the
true and perfect form of this Sacrament, the authority of the
Catholic Church, under whose guidance we have always been thus
taught, suffers us not to entertain the least doubt on the
subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Minister of Confirmation</h3>

<p>Pastors should also teach to whom especially has been
committed the administration of this Sacrament; for as, according
to the Prophet, there are many who run without being sent, it is
necessary to teach who are its true and legitimate ministers, in
order that the faithful may be enabled to receive the Sacrament
and grace of Confirmation.</p>

<p> Now the Holy Scriptures show that the Bishop alone is the
ordinary minister of this Sacrament, because we read in the Acts
of the Apostles that when Samaria had received the Word of God,
Peter and John were sent to them, who prayed for them that they
might receive the Holy Ghost: for he was not as yet come upon any
of them, but they were only baptised. Here we may see that he who
had baptised, having been only a deacon, had no power to confirm;
but that its administration was reserved to a more perfect order
of ministers, that is, to the Apostles. The same may be observed
whenever the Sacred Scriptures make mention of this Sacrament. </p>

<p> Nor are there wanting in proof of this matter the clearest
testimonies of the holy Fathers and of Popes Urban, Eusebius,
Damasus, Innocent and Leo, as is evident from their decrees. St.
Augustine, also, seriously complains of the corrupt practice of
the Egyptians and Alexandrians, whose priests dared to administer
the Sacrament of Confirmation.</p>

<p> The thorough propriety of reserving this function to Bishops
the pastor may illustrate by the following comparison. As in the
construction of buildings the artisans, who are inferior agents,
prepare and dispose cement, lime, timbers and the other material,
while to the architect belongs the completion of the work; so in
like manner this Sacrament, which is, at it were, the completion
of the spiritual edifice, should be performed by no other than
the chief priest. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sponsors at Confirmation</h3>

<p>A sponsor is also required, as we have already shown to be the
case in Baptism. For if they who enter the fencing lists have
need for some one whose skill and counsel may teach them the
thrusts and passes by which to overcome their adversaries, while
remaining safe themselves; how much more will the faithful
require a leader and monitor, when, sheathed, as it were, in the
stoutest armour by this Sacrament of Confirmation, they engage in
the spiritual conflict, in which eternal salvation is the
proposed reward. With good reason, therefore, are sponsors
employed in the administration of this Sacrament also; and the
same spiritual affinity is contracted in Confirmation, which, as
we have already shown, is contracted by sponsors in Baptism, so
as to impede the lawful marriage of the parties.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Subject of Confirmation</h3>

<p>It often happens that, in receiving this Sacrament, the
faithful are guilty of either precipitate haste or a gross
neglect and delay; concerning those who have become so impious as
to have the hardihood to contemn and despise it, we have nothing
to say. Pastors, therefore, should also explain who may receive
Confirmation, and what should be their age and dispositions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>All Should Be Confirmed</h3>

<p>First, it is necessary to teach that this Sacrament is not so
necessary as to be utterly essential to salvation. Although not
essential, however, it ought to be omitted by no one, but rather,
on the contrary, in a matter so full of holiness through which
the divine gifts are so liberally bestowed, the greater care
should be taken to avoid all neglect. What God has proposed in
common unto all for their sanctification, all should 'likewise
most earnestly desire.</p>

<p> St. Luke, indeed, describing this admirable effusion of the
Holy Spirit, says: And suddenly there came a sound from heaven,
as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house, where
they were sitting; and a little after: And they were all filled
with the Holy Ghost. From these words we may understand that, as
that house was a type and figure of the Church, the Sacrament of
Confirmation, which tool; its beginning from that day, appertains
to all the faithful.</p>

<p> This may also be easily inferred from the nature of the
Sacrament itself. For they ought to be confirmed with the sacred
chrism who have need of spiritual increase, and who are to be led
to the perfection of the Christian religion. But this is, without
exception, suited to all; because as nature intends that all her
children should grow up and attain full maturity, although she
does not always realise her wishes; so the Catholic Church, the
common mother of all, earnestly desires that, in those whom she
has regenerated by Baptism, the perfection of Christian manhood
be completed. Now as this is accomplished through the Sacrament
of mystic Unction, it is clear that Confirmation belongs alike to
all the faithful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Proper Age For Confirmation</h3>

<p>Here it is to be observed, that, after Baptism, the Sacrament
of Confirmation may indeed be administered to all; but that,
until children shall have attained the use of reason, its
administration is inexpedient. If it does not seem well to defer
(Confirmation) to the age of twelve, it is most proper to
postpone this Sacrament at least to that of seven years.</p>

<p> Confirmation has not been instituted as necessary to
salvation, but that by virtue thereof we may be found very well
armed and prepared when called upon to fight for the faith of
Christ; and for this conflict no one assuredly will consider
children who as yet lack the use of reason to be qualified.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dispositions For Receiving Confirmation</h3>

<p>From this, therefore, it follows that persons of mature age,
who are to be confirmed, must, if they desire to obtain the grace
and gifts of this Sacrament, not only bring with them faith and
piety, but also grieve from their hearts for the serious sins
which they have committed.</p>

<p> The pastor should take care that they have previous recourse
to confession of their sins; should exhort them to fasting and
other works of piety; and admonish them of the propriety of
reviving that laudable practice of the ancient Church, of
receiving this Sacrament fasting. It is to be presumed that to
this the faithful may be easily persuaded, if they but understand
the gifts and admirable effects of this Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Effects of Confirmation</h3>

<p>Pastors, therefore, should teach that, in common with the
other Sacraments, Confirmation, unless some obstacle be present
on the part of the receiver, imparts new grace. For we have shown
that these sacred and mystical signs are of such a character as
to indicate and produce grace.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Grace Of Strength</h3>

<p>But besides these things, which are common to this and the
other (Sacraments), it is peculiar to Confirmation first to
perfect the grace of Baptism. For those who have been made
Christians by Baptism, still have in some sort the tenderness and
softness, as it were, of new­born infants, and afterwards
become, by means of the Sacrament of chrism, stronger to resist
all the assaults of the world, the flesh and the devil, while
their minds are fully confirmed in faith to confess and glorify
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence; also, originated the
very name (Confirmation), as no one will doubt. For the word
Confirmation is not derived, as some not less ignorantly than
impiously have pretended, from the circumstance that persons
baptised in infancy, when arrived at mature years, were of old
brought to the Bishop, in order to confirm their faith in Christ,
which they had embraced ill Baptism, so that Confirmation would
seem not to differ from catechetical instruction. Of such a
practice no reliable testimony can be adduced. On the contrary,
the name has been derived from the fact that by virtue of this
Sacrament God confirms in us the work He commenced in Baptism,
leading us to the perfection of solid Christian virtue. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Increase In Grace</h3>

<p>But not only does it confirm, it also increases (divine
grace), as says Melchiades: The Holy Ghost, whose salutary
descent upon the waters of Baptism, imparts in the font fullness
to the accomplishment of innocence, in Confirmation gives an
increase of grace; and not only an increase, but an increase
after a wonderful manner. This the Scriptures beautifully express
by a metaphor taken from clothing: Stay you in the city, said our
Lord and Saviour, speaking of this Sacrament, until you be
clothed with power from on high. </p>

<p> If pastors wish to show the divine efficacy of this Sacrament
­­ and this, no doubt, will have great influence in affecting
the minds of the faithful ­­ it will be sufficient if they
explain what occurred to the Apostles themselves. So weak and
timid were they before, and even at the very time of the Passion,
that no sooner was our Lord apprehended, than they instantly fled
; and Peter, who had been designated the rock and foundation of
the Church, and who had displayed unshaken constancy and exalted
magnanimity, terrified at the voice of one weak woman, denied,
not once nor twice only, but a third time, that he was a disciple
of Jesus Christ; and after the Resurrection they all remained
shut up at home for fear of the Jews. But, on the day of
Pentecost, so great was the power of the Holy Ghost with which
they were all filled that, while they boldly and freely
disseminated the Gospel confided to them, not only through Judea,
but throughout the world, they thought no greater happiness could
await them than that of being accounted worthy to suffer
contumely, chains, torments and crucifixion, for the name of
Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Character Of Soldier Of Christ</h3>

<p>Confirmation has also the effect of impressing a character.
Hence, as we before said of Baptism, and as will be more fully
explained in its proper place with regard to the Sacrament of
Orders also, it can on no account ever be repeated.</p>

<p> If, then, these things be frequently and accurately explained
by pastors, it will be almost impossible that the faithful,
having known the utility and dignity of this Sacrament, should
not use every exertion to receive it with purity and devotion. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ceremonies Of Confirmation</h3>

<p>It remains now briefly to glance at the rites and ceremonies
used by the Catholic Church in the administration of this
Sacrament; and pastors will understand the great advantages of
this explanation, if they revert to what we already said on this
subject under its proper head.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Anointing Of The Forehead</h3>

<p>The forehead, then, of the persons to be confirmed is anointed
with sacred chrism; for by this Sacrament the Holy Spirit infuses
Himself into the souls of the faithful, and increases in them
strength and fortitude to enable them, in the spiritual contest,
to fight manfully and to resist their most wicked foes. Wherefore
it is indicated that they are to be deterred by no fear or shame,
the signs of which appear chiefly on the forehead, from the open
confession of the name of Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Sign Of The Cross</h3>

<p>Besides, that mark by which the Christian is distinguished
from all others, as the soldier is by certain badges, should be
impressed on the more conspicuous part of the body.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Time When Confirmation Should Be Conferred</h3>

<p>It has also been a matter of solemn religious observance in
the Church of God that this Sacrament should be administered
principally at Pentecost, because on that day especially were the
Apostles strengthened and confirmed by the power of the Holy
Ghost. By the recollection of this supernatural event the
faithful should be admonished of the nature and magnitude of the
mysteries contained in the sacred unction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Slap On The Cheek</h3>

<p>The person when anointed and confirmed next receives a gentle
slap on the cheek from the hand of the Bishop to make him
recollect that, as a valiant combatant, he should be prepared to
endure with unconquered spirit all adversities for the name of
Christ. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Pax</h3>

<p>Lastly, the peace is given him, that he may understand that he
has attained the fullness of divine grace and that peace which
passeth all understanding.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Admonition</h3>

<p>Let this, then, serve as a summary of those things which
pastors are to expound touching the Sacrament of chrism. The
exposition, however, should not be given so much in empty words
and cold language, as in the burning accents of pious and glowing
zeal, so as to seem to imprint them on the souls and inmost
thoughts of the faithful. </p>
