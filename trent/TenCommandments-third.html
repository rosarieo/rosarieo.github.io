<h3>THE THIRD COMMANDMENT: &quot;<i>Remember that thou
keep holy the sabbath day. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all
thy works; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy
god; thou shalt do no work on it, neither thou nor thy son, nor
thy daughter, nor thy man­servant, nor thy maid­servant, nor
thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six
days the lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things
that are in them, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the
lord blessed the seventh day and sanctified it</i>.&quot; </h3>

<h3>Reasons For This Commandment</h3>

<p>This Commandment of the Law rightly and in due order
prescribes the external worship which we owe to God; for it is,
as it were, a consequence of the preceding Commandment. For if we
sincerely and devoutly worship God, guided by the faith and hope
we have in Him, we cannot but honour Him with external worship
and thanksgiving. Now since we cannot easily discharge these
duties while occupied in worldly affairs, a certain fixed time
has been set aside so that it may be conveniently performed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment </h3>

<p>The observance of this Commandment is attended with wondrous
fruit and advantage. Hence it is of the highest importance for
the pastor to use the utmost diligence in its exposition. The
word Remembers with which the Commandment commences, must animate
him to zeal in this matter; for if the faithful are bound to
remember this Commandment, it becomes the duty of the pastor to
recall it frequently to their minds in exhortation and
instruction. </p>

<p> The importance of its observance for the faithful may be
inferred from the consideration that those who carefully comply
with it are more easily induced to keep all the other
Commandments. For among the other works which are necessary on
holydays, the faithful are bound to assemble in the church to
hear the Word of God. When they have thus learned the divine
justifications, they will be disposed to observe, with their
whole heart, the law of the Lord. Hence the sanctification and
observance of the Sabbath is very often commanded in Scripture,
as may be seen in Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and in the
prophecies of Isaias, Jeremias,&quot; and Ezechiel, all of which
contain this precept on the observance of the Sabbath.</p>

<p> Rulers and magistrates should be admonished and exhorted to
lend the sanction and support of their authority to the pastors
of the Church, particularly in upholding and extending the
worship of God, and in commanding obedience to the injunctions of
the priests.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How The Third Differs From The Other Commandments </h3>

<p>With regard to the exposition of this Commandment, the
faithful are carefully to be taught how it agrees with, and how
it differs from the others, in order that they may understand why
we observe and keep holy not Saturday but Sunday.</p>

<p> The point of difference is evident. The other Commandments of
the Decalogue are precepts of the natural law, obligatory at all
times and unalterable. Hence, after the abrogation of the Law of
Moses, all the Commandments contained in the two tables are
observed by Christians, not indeed because their observance is
commanded by Moses, but because they are in conformity with
nature which dictates obedience to them.</p>

<p> This Commandment about the observance of the Sabbath, on the
other hand, considered as to the time appointed for its
fulfilment, is not fixed and unalterable, but susceptible of
change, and belongs not to the moral, but the ceremonial law.
Neither is it a principle of the natural law; we are not
instructed by nature to give external worship to God on that day,
rather than on any other. And in fact the Sabbath was kept holy
only from the time of the liberation of the people of Israel from
the bondage of Pharaoh. The observance of the Sabbath was to be
abrogated at the same time as the other Hebrew rites and
ceremonies, that is, at the death of Christ. Having been, as it
were, images which foreshadowed the light and the truth, these
ceremonies were to disappear at the coming of that light and
truth, which is Jesus Christ. Hence St. Paul, in his Epistle to
the Galatians, when reproving the observers of the Mosaic rites,
says: You observe days and months and times and years; I am
afraid of you lest perhaps I have laboured in vain amongst you.
And he writes to the same effect to the Colossians. </p>

<p> So much regarding the difference (between this and the other
Commandments) .</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How The Third Is Like The Other Commandments </h3>

<p>This Commandment is like the others, not in so far as it is a
precept of the ceremonial law, but only as it is a natural and
moral precept. The worship of God and the practice of religion,
which it comprises, have the natural law for their basis. Nature
prompts us to give some time to the worship of God. This is
demonstrated by the fact that we find among all nations public
festivals consecrated to the solemnities of religion and divine
worship.</p>

<p> As nature requires some time to be given to necessary
functions of the body, to sleep, repose and the like, so she also
requires that some time be devoted to the mind, to refresh itself
by the contemplation of God. Hence, since some time should be
devoted to the worship of the Deity and to the practice of
religion, this (Commandment) doubtless forms part of the moral
law.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Jewish Sabbath Changed To Sunday By The Apostles </h3>

<p>The Apostles therefore resolved to consecrate the first day of
the week to the divine worship, and called it the Lord's day. St.
John in the Apocalypse makes mention of the Lord's day; and the
Apostle commands collections to be made on the first day of the
week, that is, according to the interpretation of St. Chrysostom,
on the Lord's day. From all this we learn that even then the
Lord's day was kept holy in the Church.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Four Parts Of This Commandment</h3>

<p>In order that the faithful may know what they are to do and
what to avoid on the Lord's day, it will not be foreign to his
purpose, if the pastor, dividing the Commandment into its four
natural parts, explain each word of it carefully.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part of this Commandment</h3>

<p>In the first place, then, he should explain generally the
meaning of these words: Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath
day. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Remember&quot;</h3>

<p>The word remember is appropriately made use of at the
beginning of the Commandment to signify that the sanctification
of that particular day belonged to the ceremonial law. Of this it
would seem to have been necessary to remind the people; for,
although the law of nature commands us to devote a certain
portion of time to the external worship to God, it fixes no
particular day for the performance of this duty.</p>

<p> They are also to be taught, that from these words we may
learn how we should employ our time during the week; that we are
to keep constantly in view the Lord's day, on which we are, as it
were, to render an account to God for our occupations and
conduct; and that therefore our works should be such as not to be
unacceptable in the sight of God, or, as it is written, be to us
an occasion of grief, and a scruple of heart.</p>

<p> Finally, we are taught, and the instruction demands our
serious attention, that there will not be wanting occasions which
may lead to a forgetfulness of this Commandment, such as the evil
example of others who neglect its observance, and an inordinate
love of amusements and sports, which frequently withdraw from the
holy and religious observance of the Lord's day.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sabbath</h3>

<p>We now come to the meaning of the word sabbath. Sabbath is a
Hebrew word which signifies cessation. To keep the Sabbath,
therefore, means to cease from labor and to rest. In this sense
the seventh day was called the Sabbath, because God, having
finished the creation of the world, rested on that day from all
the work which He had done. Thus it is called by the Lord in
Exodus.</p>

<p> Later on, not only the seventh day, but, in honour of that
day, the entire week was called by the same name; and in this
meaning of the word, the Pharisee says in St. Luke: I fast twice
in a sabbath. So much will suffice with regard to the
signification of the word sabbath.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Keep Holy&quot;</h3>

<p>In the Scriptures keeping holy the Sabbath means a cessation
from bodily labor and from business, as is clear from the
following words of the Commandment: Thou shalt do no work on it.
But this is not all that it means; otherwise it would have been
sufficient to say in Deuteronomy, Observe the day of the sabbath;
but it is added, and sanctify it; and these additional words
prove that the Sabbath is a day sacred to religion, set apart for
works of piety and devotion.</p>

<p> We sanctify the Sabbath fully and perfectly, therefore, when
we offer to God works of piety and religion. This is evidently
the Sabbath, which Isaias calls delightful; for festivals are, as
it were, the delight of God and of pious men. And if to this
religious and holy observance of the Sabbath we add works of
mercy, the rewards promised us in the same chapter are numerous
and most important.</p>

<p> The true and proper meaning, therefore, of this Commandment
tends to this, that we take special care to set apart some fixed
time, when, disengaged from bodily labor and worldly affairs, we
may devote our whole being, soul and body, to the religious
veneration of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part of this Commandment</h3>

<p>The second part of the precept declares that the seventh day
was consecrated by God to His worship; for it is written: Six
days shalt thou labour, and do all thy works; but on the seventh
day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God. From these words we learn
that the Sabbath is consecrated to the Lord, that we are required
on that day to render Him the duties of religion, and to know
that the seventh day is a sign of the Lord's rest.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;The Seventh Day Is The Sabbath Of The Lord Thy
God&quot; </h3>

<p>This particular day was fixed for the worship of God, because
it would not have been well to leave to a rude people the choice
of a time of worship, lest, perhaps, they might have imitated the
festivals of the Egyptians.</p>

<p> The last day of the week was, therefore, chosen for the
worship of God, and in this there is much that is symbolic. Hence
in Exodus,' and in Ezechiel the Lord calls it a sign: See that
you keep my sabbath because it is a sign between me and you in
your generation, that you may know that I am the Lord who
sanctify you.</p>

<p> It was a sign that man should dedicate and sanctify himself
to God, since even the very day is devoted to Him. For the
holiness of the day consists in this, that on it men are bound in
a special manner to practice holiness and religion.</p>

<p> It was also a sign, and, as it were, a memorial of the
stupendous work of the creation. Furthermore, to the Jews it was
a traditional sign, reminding them that they had been delivered
by the help of God from the galling yoke of Egyptian bondage.
This the Lord Himself declares in these words: Remember that thou
also didst serve in Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out
from thence with a strong hand and a stretched out arm. Therefore
hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath
day.</p>

<p> It is also a sign of a spiritual and celestial sabbath. The
spiritual sabbath consists in a holy and mystical rest, wherein
the old man being buried with Christ, is renewed to life and
carefully applies himself to act in accordance with the spirit of
Christian piety. For those who were once darkness but are now
light in the Lord, should walk as children of the light, in all
goodness and justice and truth, having no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness.</p>

<p> The celestial sabbath, as St. Cyril observes on these words
of the Apostle, There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the
people of God, is that life in which, living with Christ, we
shall enjoy all good, when sin shall be eradicated, according to
the words: No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous
beast go up by it, nor be found there; but a path shall be there,
and it shall be called the holy way; for in the vision of God the
souls of the Saints obtain every good. The pastor therefore
should exhort and animate the faithful in the words: Let us
hasten therefore to enter into that rest.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Festivals Observed By The Jews</h3>

<p>Besides the seventh day, the Jews observed other festivals and
holydays, instituted by the divine law to awaken the recollection
of the principal favours (conferred on them by the Almighty). </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Sabbath, Why Changed To Sunday</h3>

<p>But the Church of God has thought it well to transfer the
celebration and observance of the Sabbath to Sunday.</p>

<p> For, as on that day light first shone on the world, so by the
Resurrection of our Redeemer on the same day, by whom was thrown
open to us the gate to eternal life, we were called out of
darkness into light; and hence the Apostles would have it called
the Lord's day.</p>

<p> We also learn from the Sacred Scriptures that the first day
of the week was held sacred because on that day the work of
creation commenced, and on that day the Holy Ghost was given to
the Apostles. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Festivals Observed By The Church</h3>

<p>From the very infancy of the Church and in the following
centuries other days were also appointed by the Apostles and the
holy Fathers, in order to commemorate the benefits bestowed by
God. Among these days to be kept sacred the most solemn are those
which were instituted to honour the mysteries of our redemption.
In the next place are the days which are dedicated to the most
Blessed Virgin Mother, to the Apostles, Martyrs and other Saints
who reign with Christ. In the celebration of their victories the
divine power and goodness are praised, due honour is paid to
their memories, and the faithful are encouraged to imitate them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Six Days Shalt Thou Labour And Do All Thy
Work&quot; </h3>

<p>And as the observance of the precept is very strongly assisted
by these words: Six days shalt thou labour, but on the seventh
day is the sabbath of God, the pastor should therefore carefully
explain them to the people. For from these words it can be
gathered that the faithful are to be exhorted not to spend their
lives in indolence and sloth, but that each one, mindful of the
words of the Apostle, should do his own business, and work with
his own hands, as he had commanded them.</p>

<p> These words also enjoin as a duty commanded by God that in
six days we do all our works, lest we defer to a festival what
should have been done during the other days of the week, thereby
distracting the attention from the things of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Third Part of this Commandment</h3>

<p>The third part of the Commandment comes next to be explained.
It points out, to a certain extent, the manner in which we are to
keep holy the Sabbath day, and explains particularly what we are
forbidden to do on that day.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Works Forbidden</h3>

<p>Thou shalt do no work on it, says the Lord, thou, nor thy son,
nor thy daughter, nor thy man­servant, nor thy maid­servant,
nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.</p>

<p> These words teach us, in the first place, to avoid whatever
may interfere with the worship of God. Hence it is not difficult
to perceive that all servile works are forbidden, not because
they are improper or evil in themselves, but because they
withdraw the attention from the worship of God, which is the
great end of the Commandment.</p>

<p> The faithful should be still more careful to avoid sin, which
not only withdraws the mind from the contemplation of divine
things, but entirely alienates us from the love of God. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Works Permitted</h3>

<p>But whatever regards the celebration of divine worship, such
as the decoration of the altar or church on occasion of some
festival, and the like, although servile works, are not
prohibited; and hence our Lord says: The priests in the temple
break the sabbath, and are without blame.</p>

<p> Neither are we to suppose that this Commandment forbids
attention to those things on a feast day, which, if neglected,
will be lost; for this is expressly permitted by the sacred
canons. </p>

<p> There are many other things which our Lord in the Gospel
declares lawful on festivals and which may be seen by the pastor
in St. Matthew and St. John.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why Animals Are Not To Be Employed On The Sabbath </h3>

<p>To omit nothing that may interfere with the sanctification of
the Sabbath, the Commandment mentions beasts of burden, because
their use will prevent its due observance. If beasts be employed
on the Sabbath, human labor also becomes necessary to direct
them; for they do not labor alone, but assist the labours of man.
Now it is not lawful for man to work on that day. Hence it is not
lawful for the animals to work which man uses.</p>

<p> But the Commandment has also another purpose. For. if God
commands the exemption of cattle from labor on the Sabbath, still
more imperative is the obligation to avoid all acts of inhumanity
towards servants, or others whose labor and industry we employ. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Works Commanded Or Recommended</h3>

<p>The pastor should also not omit carefully to teach what works
and actions Christians should perform on festival days. These
are: to go to church, and there, with heartfelt piety and
devotion, to assist at the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of
the Mass; and to approach frequently the Sacraments of the
Church, instituted for our salvation in order to obtain a remedy
for the wounds of the soul.</p>

<p> Nothing can be more seasonable or salutary for Christians
than frequent recourse to confession; and to this the pastor will
be enabled to exhort the faithful by using the instructions and
proofs which have been explained in their own place on the
Sacrament of Penance.</p>

<p> But not only should he urge his people to have recourse to
that Sacrament, he should also zealously exhort them again and
again to approach frequently the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist.
</p>

<p> The faithful should also listen with attention and reverence
to sermons. Nothing is more intolerable, nothing more unworthy
than to despise the words of Christ, or hear them with
indifference. </p>

<p> Likewise the faithful should give themselves to frequent
prayer and the praises of God; and an object of their special
attention should be to learn those things which pertain to a
Christian life, and to practice with care the duties of piety,
such as giving alms to the poor and needy, visiting the sick, and
administering consolation to the sorrowful and afflicted.
Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
says St. James, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
tribulation.</p>

<p> From what has been said it is easy to perceive how this
Commandment may be violated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Motives for the Observance of this Commandment </h3>

<p>It is also a duty of the pastor to have ready at hand certain
main arguments by which he may especially persuade the people to
observe this Commandment with all zeal and the greatest
exactitude. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reasonableness Of This Duty</h3>

<p>To the attainment of this end it will materially conduce, if
the people understand and clearly see how just and reasonable it
is to devote certain days exclusively to the worship of God in
order to acknowledge, adore, and venerate our Lord from whom we
have received such innumerable and inestimable blessings. </p>

<p> Had He commanded us to offer Him every day the tribute of
religious worship, would it not be our duty, in return for His
inestimable and infinite benefits towards us, to endeavour to
obey the command with promptitude and alacrity? But now that the
days consecrated to His worship are but few, there is no excuse
for neglecting or reluctantly performing this duty, which
moreover obliges under grave sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Observance Of This Commandment Brings Many
Blessings</h3>

<p>The pastor should next point out the excellence of this
precept. Those who are faithful in its observance are admitted,
as it were, into the divine presence to speak freely with God;
for in prayer we contemplate the divine majesty, and commune with
Him; in hearing religious instruction, we hear the voice of God,
which reaches us through the agency of those who devoutly preach
on divine things; and at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, we adore
Christ the Lord, present on our altars. Such are the blessings
which they preeminently enjoy who faithfully observe this
Commandment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Neglect Of This Commandment A Great Crime</h3>

<p>But those who altogether neglect its fulfilment resist God and
His Church; they heed not God's command, and are enemies of Him
and His holy laws, of which the easiness of the command is itself
a proof. We should, it is true, be prepared to undergo the
severest labor for the sake of God; but in this Commandment He
imposes on us no labor; He only commands us to rest and disengage
ourselves from worldly cares on those days which are to be kept
holy. To refuse obedience to this Commandment is, therefore, a
proof of extreme boldness; and the punishments with which its
infraction has been visited by God, as we learn from the Book of
Numbers,' should be a warning to us.</p>

<p> In order, therefore, to avoid offending God in this way, we
should frequently ponder this word: Remember, and should place
before our minds the important advantages and blessings which, as
we have already seen, flow from the religious observance of
holydays, and also numerous other considerations of the same
tendency, which the good and zealous pastor should develop at
considerable length to his people as circumstances may require. </p>
