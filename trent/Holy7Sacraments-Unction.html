<h3><center>THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On Extreme Unction </h3>

<p>In all thy works, the Scriptures teach, remember thy last end,
and thou shalt never sin, words which convey to the pastor a
silent admonition to omit no opportunity of exhorting the
faithful to constant meditation on death. The Sacrament of
Extreme Unction, because inseparably associated with recollection
of the day of death, should, it is obvious, form a subject of
frequent instruction, not only because it is right to explain the
mysteries of salvation, but also because death, the inevitable
doom of all men, when recalled to the minds of the faithful,
represses depraved passion. Thus shall they be less disturbed by
the approach of death, and will pour forth their gratitude in
endless praises to God, who has not only opened to us the way to
true life in the Sacrament of Baptism, but has also instituted
that of Extreme Unction, to afford us, when departing this mortal
life, an easier way to heaven. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Names of this Sacrament</h3>

<p>In explaining what is more necessary on this subject we shall
follow almost the same order observed in the exposition of the
other Sacraments. Hence we shall first show that this Sacrament
is called Extreme Unction, because among all the unctions
prescribed by our Lord to His Church, this is the last to be
administered. </p>

<p> For this reason it was also called by our predecessors in the
faith, the Sacrament of the anointing of the sick, and also the
Sacrament of the dying, names which easily turn the minds of the
faithful to the remembrance of that last hour.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Extreme Unction Is a True Sacrament</h3>

<p>That Extreme Unction is strictly speaking a Sacrament, is
first to be explained; and this the words of St. James the
Apostle, promulgating the law of this Sacrament, clearly
establish. Is any man, he says, sick amongst you ? Let him bring
in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of
faith shall save the sick man; and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. When the
Apostle says that sins are forgiven, he ascribes to Extreme
Unction the nature and efficacy of a Sacrament.</p>

<p> That such has been at all times the doctrine of the Catholic
Church on Extreme Unction, many Councils testify, and the Council
of Trent denounces anathema against all who presume to teach or
think otherwise. Innocent I also recommends this Sacrament with
great earnestness to the attention of the faithful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Extreme Unction Is But One Sacrament</h3>

<p>Pastors, therefore, should teach that Extreme Unction is a
true Sacrament, and that, although administered with many
anointings, each given with a peculiar prayer, and under a
peculiar form, it constitutes not many, but one Sacrament. It is
one, however, not in the sense that it is composed of inseparable
parts, but because each of the parts contributes to its
perfection, as is the case with every object composed of many
parts. As a house which consists of a great variety of parts
derives its perfection from unity of plan, so is this Sacrament,
although composed of many and different things and words, but one
sign, and it effects only that one thing of which it is the sign.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Essential Parts of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>Pastors should also teach what are the component parts of this
Sacrament, its matter and form. These St. James does not omit,
and each is replete with its own peculiar mysteries. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Matter Of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>Its element, then, or matter, as defined by Councils,
particularly by the Council of Trent, consists of oil consecrated
by the Bishop. Not any kind of oil extracted from fatty or greasy
substances, but olive oil alone (can be the matter of this
Sacrament). </p>

<p> Thus its matter is most significant of what is inwardly
effected in the soul by the Sacrament. Oil is very efficacious in
soothing bodily pain, and the power of this Sacrament lessens the
pain and anguish of the soul. Oil also restores health, brings
joy, feeds light, and is very efficacious in refreshing bodily
fatigue. All these effects signify what the divine power
accomplishes in the sick man through the administration of this
Sacrament. So much will suffice in explanation of the matter.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Form Of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>The form of the Sacrament is the word and solemn prayer which
the priest uses at each anointing: By this Holy Unction may God
pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed by the evil use of
sight, smell or touch.</p>

<p> That this is the true form of this Sacrament we learn from
these words of St. James: Let them pray over him . . . and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick man. Hence we can see that
the form is to be applied by way of prayer. The Apostle does not
say of what particular words that prayer is to consist; but this
form has been handed down to us by the faithful tradition of the
Fathers, so that all the Churches retain the form observed by the
Church of Rome, the mother and mistress of all Churches. Some, it
is true, alter a few words, as when for God pardon thee, they say
(God) remit, or (God) spare, and sometimes, May (God) remedy all
the evil thou hast committed. But as there is no change of
meaning, it is clear that all religiously observe the same form.</p>

<p> It should not excite surprise that, while the form of each of
the other Sacraments either absolutely signifies what it
expresses, such as I baptise thee, or I Sign thee with the sign
of the cross, or is pronounced, as it were, by way of command, as
in administering Holy Orders, Receive power, the form of Extreme
Unction alone is expressed by way of prayer. Wisely has it been
so appointed. For since this Sacrament is administered not only
for the spiritual grace which it bestows, but also for the
recovery of health, which, however, is not always obtained,
therefore use a deprecative form, in order to implore of God's
mercy what the virtue of the Sacrament does not always and
uniformly effect. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ceremonies Of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>In the administration of this Sacrament special rites are also
used, consisting principally of prayers offered by the priest for
the recovery of the sick person. There is no Sacrament, the
administration of which is accompanied with more numerous
prayers; and with good reason, for at that moment more than ever
the faithful require the assistance of pious prayers. All who may
be present, and especially the pastor, should pour out their
fervent aspirations to God, and earnestly commend to His mercy
the life and salvation of the sufferer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Institution of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>Having thus proved that Extreme Unction is truly and properly
to be numbered among the Sacraments, we rightly infer that it
owes its institution to Christ our Lord. It was subsequently made
known and promulgated to the faithful by the Apostle St. James. </p>

<p> Our Saviour Himself, however, seems to have given some
indication of it, when He sent His disciples two and two before
Him; for the Evangelist informs us that going forth, they
preached that all should do penance; and they cast out many
devils, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed
them.</p>

<p> This anointing cannot be supposed to have been invented by
the Apostles, but was commanded by our Lord. Nor did its power
arise from any natural virtue. Its efficacy, we must believe, was
mystical, having been instituted to heal the maladies of the
soul, rather than to cure the diseases of the body. This is the
doctrine taught by St. Denis, St. Ambrose, St. Chrysostom and St.
Gregory the Great; so that it cannot be at all doubted that
Extreme Unction is to be recognised and venerated as one of the
seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Subject of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>But although instituted for the use of all, Extreme Unction is
not lo be administered indiscriminately to all.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Subject Must Be In Danger Of Death</h3>

<p>In the first place, it is not to be administered to persons in
sound health, according to these words of St. James: Is anyone
sick amongst you? This is also proved by the fact that Extreme
Unction was instituted as a remedy not only for the diseases of
the soul, but also for those of the body. Now only the sick need
a remedy, and therefore this Sacrament is to be administered to
those only whose malady is such as to excite apprehensions of
approaching death.</p>

<p> It is, however, a very grievous sin to defer the Holy Unction
until, all hope of recovery being lost, life begins to ebb, and
the sick person is fast verging into a state of insensibility. It
is obvious that if the Sacrament is administered while
consciousness and reason are yet unimpaired, and the mind is
capable of eliciting acts of faith and of directing the will to
sentiments of piety, a more abundant participation of its graces
must be received. Though this heavenly medicine is in itself
always salutary, pastors should be careful to apply it when its
efficacy can be aided by the piety and devotion of the sick
person.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Danger Must Arise From Sickness</h3>

<p>Extreme Unction, then, can be administered to no one who is
not dangerously sick; not even to those who are in danger of
death, as when they undertake a perilous voyage, or enter into
battle with the sure prospect of death, or have been condemned to
death and are on the way to execution.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Person Anointed Must Have Attained The Use Of
Reason</h3>

<p>Furthermore, all those who have not the use of reason are not
fit subjects for this Sacrament; and likewise children who,
having committed no sins, do not need the Sacrament as a remedy
against the remains of sin. The same is true of idiots and insane
persons, unless they give indications in their lucid intervals of
a disposition to piety, and express a desire to be anointed. To
persons who from their birth never enjoyed the use of reason this
Sacrament is not to be administered; but if a sick person, while
in the possession of his faculties, expresses a wish to receive
Extreme Unction and afterwards becomes delirious he is to be
anointed. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Administration of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>The Sacred Unction is to be applied not to the entire body,
but to the organs of sense only, ­­ to the eyes, on account of
sight; to the ears, on account of hearing; to the nostrils, on
account of smell; to the mouth, on account of taste and speech;
to the hands, on account of touch. The sense of touch, it is
true, is diffused throughout the entire body, yet it is more
developed in the hands.</p>

<p> This manner of administering Extreme Unction is observed
throughout the universal Church, and is in keeping with the
medicinal nature of the Sacrament. As in corporal disease,
although the malady affects the entire body, yet the cure is
applied to that part only which is the seat and origin of the
disease; so likewise this Sacrament is applied not to the entire
body, but to those members in which the power of sensation is
most conspicuous, and also to the loins, which are, as it were,
the seat of concupiscence, and to the feet, by which we move from
one place to another.</p>

<p> Here it is to be observed that, during the same illness, and
while the danger of dying continues the same, the sick person is
to be anointed but once. Should he, however, recover after he has
been anointed, he may receive the aid of this Sacrament as often
as he shall have relapsed into the same danger of death. This
Sacrament, therefore, is evidently to be numbered among those
which may be repeated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dispositions for the Reception of Extreme Unction </h3>

<p>As all care should be taken that nothing impede the. grace of
the Sacrament, and as nothing is more opposed to it than the
consciousness of mortal guilt, the constant practice of the
Catholic Church must be observed of administering the Sacrament
of Penance and the Eucharist before Extreme Unction.</p>

<p> And next, let parish priests strive to persuade the sick
person to receive this Sacrament from the priest with the same
faith with which those of old who were to be healed by the
Apostles used to present themselves. But the salvation of his
soul is to be the first object of the sick man's wishes, and
after that the health of the body, with this qualification, if it
be for the good of his soul.</p>

<p> Nor should the faithful doubt that those holy and solemn
prayers which are used by the priest, not in his own person, but
in that of the Church and of our Lord Jesus Christ, are heard by
God; and they are most particularly to be exhorted on this one
point, to take care that the Sacrament of this most salutary oil
be administered to them holily and religiously, when the sharper
conflict seems at hand, and the energies of the mind as well as
of the body appear to be failing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Minister of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>Who the minister of Extreme Unction is we learn from the same
Apostle that promulgated the law of the Lord; for he says: Let
him bring in the priests (presbyters). By which name, as the
Council of Trent has well explained, he does not mean persons
advanced in years, or of chief authority among the people, but
priests who have been duly ordained by Bishops with the
imposition of hands.</p>

<p> To the priest, therefore, has been committed the
administration of this Sacrament; not, however, to every priest,
as holy Church has decreed, but to the proper pastor who has
jurisdiction, or to another authorised by him to discharge this
office.</p>

<p> In this, however, as also in the administration of the other
Sacraments, it is to be most distinctly remembered that the
priest is the representative of Christ our Lord, and of His
spouse, holy Church. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Effects of Extreme Unction</h3>

<p>The advantages we receive from this Sacrament are also to be
accurately explained, so that if nothing else can allure the
faithful to its reception, they may be induced at least by its
utility; for we are naturally disposed to measure almost all
things by our interests.</p>

<p> Pastors, therefore, should teach that by this Sacrament is
imparted grace that remits sins, and especially lighter, or as
they are commonly called, venial sins; for mortal sins are
removed by the Sacrament of Penance. Extreme Unction was not
instituted primarily for the remission of grave offences; only
Baptism and Penance accomplish this directly.</p>

<p> Another advantage of the Sacred Unction is that it liberates
the soul from the languor and infirmity which it contracted from
sins, and from all the other remains of sin. The time most
opportune for this cure is when we are afflicted with severe
illness and danger to life impends, for it has been implanted in
man by nature to dread no human visitation so much as death. This
dread is greatly augmented by the recollection of our past sins,
especially if our conscience accuses us of grave offences; for it
is written: They shall come with fear at the thought of their
sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict
them. Another source of vehement anguish is the anxious thought
that we must soon afterwards stand before the judgment seat of
God, who will pass on us a sentence of strictest justice
according to our deserts. It often happens that, struck with this
terror, the faithful feel themselves deeply agitated; and nothing
conduces more to a tranquil death than to banish sadness, await
with a joyous mind the coming of our Lord, and be ready willingly
to surrender the deposit entrusted whenever it shall be His will
to demand it back. To free the minds of the faithful from this
solicitude, and fill the soul with pious and holy joy is, then,
an effect of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. </p>

<p> From it, moreover, we derive another advantage, which may
justly be deemed the greatest of all. For although the enemy of
the human race never ceases, while we live, to meditate our ruin
and destruction, yet at no time does he more violently use every
effort utterly to destroy us, and, if possible, deprive us of all
hope of the divine mercy, than when he sees the last day of life
approach. Therefore arms and strength are supplied to the
faithful in this Sacrament to enable them to break the violence
and impetuosity of the adversary, and to fight bravely against
him; for the soul of the sick is relieved and encouraged by the
hope of the divine goodness, strengthened by which it bears more
lightly ail the burdens of sickness, and eludes with greater ease
the artifice and cunning of the devil who lies in wait for it.</p>

<p> Finally, the recovery of health, if indeed advantageous, is
another effect of this Sacrament. And if in our days the sick
obtain this effect less frequently, this is to be attributed, not
to any defect of the Sacrament, but rather to the weaker faith of
a great part of those who are anointed with the sacred oil, or by
whom it is administered; for the Evangelist bears witness that
the Lord wrought not many miracles among His own, because of
their unbelief.</p>

<p> It may also be truly said at the Christian religion, since it
has struck its roots more deeply in the minds of men, stands now
less in need of the aids of such miracles than it did formerly,
at the commencement of the rising Church. Nevertheless, faith
should be strongly excited in this respect, and whatever it may
please God in His wisdom to do with regard to the health of the
body, the faithful ought to rely on a sure hope of attaining, by
virtue of this sacred oil, health of the soul, and of
experiencing, should the hour of their departure from life be at
hand, the fruit of that glorious assurance: Blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Admonition</h3>

<p>We have thus explained briefly the Sacrament of Extreme
Unction. But if these points are developed by the pastor at
greater length and with the care the subject demands, it is not
to be doubted that the faithful will derive very great fruit of
piety from his instruction.</p>
