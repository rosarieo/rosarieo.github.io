<h3><center>ARTICLE VI : &quot;HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN,
SITTETH AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY&quot;<center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>Filled with the Spirit of God, and contemplating the blessed
and glorious Ascension of our Lord, the Prophet David exhorts all
to celebrate that splendid triumph with the greatest joy and
gladness: Clap your hands, all ye nations: shout unto God with he
voice of joy.... God is ascended with jubilee.</p>

<p> The pastor will hence learn that this mystery should be
explained with the greatest diligence; and that he should take
care that the people not only perceive it with faith and
understanding, but that they also strive as far as possible, with
the Lord's help to reflect it in their lives and actions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part of this Article: &quot;He Ascended into
Heaven&quot; </h3>

<p>With regard, then, to the exposition of this sixth Article,
which has reference principally to this divine mystery, we shall
begin with its first part, and point out its force and meaning.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Into Heaven&quot;</h3>

<p>This, then, the faithful must believe without hesitation, that
Jesus Christ, having fully accomplished the work of Redemption,
ascended as man, body and soul, into heaven; for as God He never
forsook heaven, filling as He does all places with His Divinity. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;He Ascended&quot;</h3>

<p>The pastor is also to teach that He ascended by His own power,
not being taken up by the power of another, as was Elias, who was
carried to heaven in a fiery chariot; or, as the Prophet Habacuc,
or Philip, the deacon, who were borne through the air by the
divine power, and traversed great distances.</p>

<p> Neither did He ascend into heaven solely by the exercise of
His supreme power as God, but also by virtue of the power which
He possessed as man. Although human power alone was insufficient
to accomplish this, yet the virtue with which the blessed soul of
Christ was endowed was capable of moving the body as it pleased,
and His body, now glorified, readily obeyed the behest of the
soul that moved it. Hence, we believe that Christ ascended into
heaven as God and man by His own power.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part of this Article: &quot;Sitteth at the
Right Hand of God the Father Almighty&quot;</h3>

<p>The words He sitteth at the right hand of the Father form the
second part of this Article. In these words we observe a figure
of speech; that is, a use of words in other than their literal
sense, as frequently happens in Scripture, when, accommodating
its language to human ideas, it attributes human affections and
human members to God, who, spirit as He is, admits of nothing
corporeal.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;At the Right Hand&quot;</h3>

<p>As among men he who sits at the right hand is considered to
occupy the most honourable place, so, transferring the same idea
to celestial things, to express the glory which Christ as man has
obtained above all others, we confess that He sits at the right
hand of the Father.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Sitteth&quot;</h3>

<p>To sit does not imply here position and posture of body, but
expresses the firm and permanent possession of royal and supreme
power and glory which He received from the Father, and of which
the Apostle says: Raising him up from the dead, and setting him
on his right hand in the heavenly places, above all principality,
and power, and virtue, and domination, and every name that is
named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
and he hath subjected all things under his feet. These words
manifestly imply that this glory belongs to our Lord in so
special and exclusive a manner that it cannot apply to any other
created being. Hence in another place the Apostle testifies: To
which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reflections on the Ascension:</h3>

<h3>Its History</h3>

<p>The pastor should explain the sense of the Article more at
length by detailing the history of the Ascension, of which the
Evangelist St. Luke has left us an orderly description in the
Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Greatness Of This Mystery</h3>

<p>In this exposition he should observe, in the first place, that
all other mysteries refer to the Ascension as to their end and
find in it their perfection and completion; for as all the
mysteries of religion commence with the Incarnation of our Lord,
so His sojourn on earth terminates with His Ascension.</p>

<p> Moreover the other Articles of the Creed which regard Christ
the Lord show His great humility and lowliness. Nothing can be
conceived more humble, nothing more lowly, than that the Son of
God assumed our weak human nature, and suffered and died for us.
But nothing more magnificently, nothing more admirably, proclaims
His sovereign glory and divine majesty than what is contained in
the present and in the preceding Article, in which we declare
that He rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and sits at the
right hand of God the Father.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reasons Of The Ascension</h3>

<p>When the pastor has explained these truths, he should next
accurately show why Christ the Lord ascended into heaven. </p>

<p> First of all, He ascended because the glorious kingdom of the
highest heavens, not the obscure abode of this earth, presented a
suitable dwelling place for Him whose body, rising from the tomb,
was clothed with the glory of immortality.</p>

<p> He ascended, however, not only to possess the throne of glory
and the kingdom which He had merited by His blood, but also to
attend to whatever regards our salvation.</p>

<p> Again, He ascended to prove thereby that His kingdom is not
of this world. For the kingdoms of this world are earthly and
transient, and are based upon wealth and the power of the flesh;
but the kingdom of Christ is not, as the Jews expected, earthly,
but spiritual and eternal. Its resources and riches, too, are
spiritual, as He showed by placing His throne in the heavens,
where they are counted richer and wealthier who seek most
earnestly the things that are of God, according to these words of
St. James: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in
faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them
that love him?</p>

<p> He also ascended into heaven in order to teach us to follow
Him thither in mind and heart. For as by His death and
Resurrection He bequeathed to us an example of dying and rising
again in spirit, so by His Ascension He teaches and instructs us
that though dwelling on earth, we should raise ourselves in
desire to heaven, confessing that we are pilgrims and strangers
on the earth, seeking a country and that we are fellowÂ­citizens
with the saints, and the domestics of God, for, says the same
Apostle, our conversation is in heaven</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Results Of The Ascension</h3>

<p>The extent and greatness of the unutterable blessings which
the bounty of God has showered on us were long before, as the
Apostle interprets, sung by the inspired David: Ascending on
high, he led captivity captive: He gave gifts to men.' For on the
tenth day He sent down the Holy Ghost, with whose power and
plenitude He filled the multitude of the faithful then present,
and so fulfilled that splendid promise: It is expedient to you
that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you;
but if I go, I will send him to you.</p>

<p> He also ascended into heaven, according to the Apostle, that
he may appear in the presence of God f or us, and discharge for
us the office of advocate with the Father. My little children,
says St. John, these things I write to you, that you may not sin.
But if any man sin, we have an. advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the just: and he is the propitiation for our sins. There
is nothing from which the faithful should derive greater joy and
gladness of soul than from the reflection that Jesus Christ is
constituted our advocate and the mediator of our salvation with
the Eternal Father, with whom His influence and authority are
supreme.</p>

<p> Finally, by His Ascension He has prepared for us a place, as
He had promised, and has entered, as our head, in the name of us
all, into the possession of the glory of heaven.&quot; Ascending
into heaven, He threw open its gates, which had been closed by
the sin of Adam; and, as He foretold to His disciples at His Last
Supper, secured to us a way by which we may arrive at eternal
happiness. In order to give an open proof of this by its
fulfilment, He introduced with Himself into the mansions of
eternal bliss the souls of the just whom He had liberated from
hell.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Virtues Promoted By The Ascension.</h3>

<p>A series of important advantages followed in the train of this
admirable profusion of celestial gifts. In the first place, the
merit of our faith was considerably augmented; because faith has
for its object those things which fall not under the senses, but
are far raised above the reach of human reason and intelligence.
If, therefore, the Lord had not departed from us, the merit of
our faith would not be the same; for Christ the Lord has said:
Blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed </p>

<p> In the next place, the Ascension of Christ into heaven
contributes much to confirm our hope. Believing that Christ, as
man, ascended into heaven, and placed our nature at the right
hand of God the Father, we are animated with a strong hope that
we, as members, shall also ascend thither, to be there united to
our Head, according to these words of our Lord Himself: Father, I
will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be
with me</p>

<p> Another most important advantage is that He has taken our
affections to heaven and inflamed them with the Spirit of God;
for most truly has it been said that where our treasure is, there
also is our heart. And, indeed, were Christ the Lord still
dwelling on earth, the contemplation of His human nature and His
company would absorb all our thoughts, and we should view the
author of such blessings only as man, and cherish towards Him a
sort of earthly affection. But by His Ascension into heaven He
has spiritualised our affection and has made us venerate and love
as God Him whom, on account of His absence, we see only in
thought. This we learn in part from the example of the Apostles,
who while our Lord was personally present with them, seemed to
judge of Him in some measure in a human light; and in part from
these words of our Lord Himself: It is expedient to you that I
go. The imperfect affection with which they loved Christ Jesus
when present had to be perfected by divine love, and that by the
coming of the Holy Ghost; and therefore He immediately subjoins:
If I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ascension Benefits The Church And The Individual </h3>

<p>Besides, He thus enlarged His household on earth, that is, His
Church, which was to be governed by the power and guidance of the
Holy Spirit. He left Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, as its
chief pastor and supreme head upon earth; moreover he gave some
apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and
other some pastors and doctors. Thus seated at the right hand of
the Father He continually bestows different gifts on different
men; for as the Apostle testifies: To every one of us is given
grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.</p>

<p> Finally, what we have already taught of the mystery of His
death and Resurrection the faithful should deem not less true of
His Ascension. For although we owe our Redemption and salvation
to the Passion of Christ, whose merits opened heaven to the just,
yet His Ascension is not only proposed to us as a model, which
teaches us to look on high and ascend in spirit into heaven, but
it also imparts to us a divine virtue which enables us to
accomplish what it teaches.</p>
