<h3><center>ARTICLE II : &quot;AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS
ONLY SON, OUR LORD&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Advantages Of Faith In This Article</h3>

<p>That wonderful and superabundant are the blessings which flow
to the human race from the belief and profession of this Article
we learn from these words of St. John: Whosoever shall confess
that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God;
and also from the words of Christ the Lord, proclaiming the
Prince of the Apostles blessed for the confession of this truth:
Blessed art thou, Simon Bar­Jona: for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. For this
Article is the most firm basis of our salvation and redemption. </p>

<p> But as the fruit of these admirable blessings is best known
by considering the ruin brought on man by his fall from that most
happy state in which God had placed our first parents, let the
pastor be particularly careful to make known to the faithful the
cause of this common misery and calamity.</p>

<p> When Adam had departed from the obedience due to God and had
violated the prohibition, of every tree of paradise thou shalt
eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
not eat, for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt
die the death, he fell into the extreme misery of losing the
sanctity and righteousness in which he had been placed, and of
becoming subject to all those other evils which have been
explained more fully by the holy Council of Trent.</p>

<p> Wherefore, the pastor should not omit to remind the faithful
that the guilt and punishment of original sin were not confined
to Adam, but justly descended from him, as from their source and
cause, to all posterity. The human race, having fallen from its
elevated dignity, no power of men or Angels could raise it from
its fallen condition and replace it in its primitive state. To
remedy the evil and repair the loss it became necessary that the
Son of God, whose power is infinite, clothed in the weakness of
our flesh, should remove the infinite weight of sin and reconcile
us to God in His blood.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of Faith In This Article</h3>

<p>The belief and profession of this our redemption, which God
declared from the beginning, are now, and always have been,
necessary to salvation. In the sentence of condemnation
pronounced against the human race immediately after the sin of
Adam the hope of redemption was held out in these words, which
announced to the devil the loss he was to sustain by man's
redemption: I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and
thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt
lie in wait f or her heel.</p>

<p> The same promise God again often confirmed and more
distinctly manifested to those chiefly whom He desired to make
special objects of His favour; among others to the Patriarch
Abraham, to whom He often declared this mystery, but more
explicitly when, in obedience to His command, Abraham was
prepared to sacrifice his only son Isaac. Because, said God, thou
hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only­begotten son
f or my sake; I win bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as
the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore.
Thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies, and in thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou
hast obeyed my voice. From these words it was easy to infer that
He who was to deliver mankind from the ruthless tyranny of Satan
was to be descended from Abraham; and that while He was the Son
of God, He was to be born of the seed of Abraham according to the
flesh.</p>

<p> Not long after, to preserve the memory of this promise, God
renewed the same covenant with Jacob, the grandson of Abraham.
When in a vision Jacob saw a ladder standing on earth, and its
top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God ascending and
descending by it, as the Scriptures testify, he also heard the
Lord, who was leaning on the ladder, say to him: I am the Lord
God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land,
wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed. And
thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth. Thou shalt spread
abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the
south; and in thee and thy seed all the nations of the earth
shall be blessed.</p>

<p> Nor did God cease afterwards to excite in the posterity of
Abraham and in many others, the expectation of a Saviour, by
renewing the recollection of the same promise; for after the
establishment of the Jewish State and religion it became better
known to His people. Types signified and men foretold what and
how great blessings the Saviour and Redeemer, Christ Jesus, was
to bring to mankind. And indeed the Prophets, whose minds were
illuminated with light from above, foretold the birth of the Son
of God, the wondrous works which He wrought while on earth, His
doctrine, character, life, death, Resurrection, and the other
mysterious circumstances regarding Him, and all these they
announced to the people as graphically as if they were passing
before their eyes. With the exception that one has reference to
the future and the other to the past, we can discover no
difference between the predictions of the Prophets and the
preaching of the Apostles, between the faith of the ancient
Patriarchs and that of Christians.</p>

<p> But we are now to speak of the several parts of this Article.
</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Jesus&quot;</h3>

<p>Jesus is the proper name of the God­man and signifies
Saviour: a name given Him not accidentally, or by the judgment or
will of man, but by the counsel and command of God. For the Angel
announced to Mary His mother: Behold thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name
Jesus. He afterwards not only commanded Joseph, who was espoused
to the Virgin, to call the child by that name, but also declared
the reason why He should be so called. Joseph, son of David, said
the Angel, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that
which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall
bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he
shall save his people from their sins.</p>

<p> In the Sacred Scriptures we meet with many who were called by
this name. So, for example, was called the son of Nave, who
succeeded Moses, and, by special privilege denied to Moses,
conducted into the land of promise the people whom Moses had
delivered from Egypt; and also the son of Josedech, the priest.
But how much more appropriate it is to call by this name our
Saviour, who gave light, liberty and salvation, not to one people
only, but to all men, of all ages to men oppressed, not by
famine, or Egyptian or Babylonian bondage, but sitting in the
shadow of death and fettered by the galling chains of sin and of
the devil who purchased for them a right to the inheritance of
heaven and reconciled them to God the Father! In those men who
were designated by the same name we see foreshadowed Christ the
Lord, by whom the blessings just enumerated were poured out on
the human race.</p>

<p> All other names which according to prophecy were to be given
by divine appointment to the Son of God, are comprised in this
one name Jesus; for while they partially signified the salvation
which He was to bestow upon us, this name included the force and
meaning of all human salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Christ&quot;</h3>

<p>To the name Jesus is added that of Christ, which signifies the
anointed. This name is expressive of honour and office, and is
not peculiar to one thing only, but common to many; for in the
Old Law priests and kings, whom God, on account of the dignity of
their office, commanded to he anointed, were called christs. For
priests commend the people to God by unceasing prayer, offer
sacrifice to Him, and turn away His wrath from mankind. Kings are
entrusted with the government of the people; and to them
principally belong the authority of the law, the protection of
innocence and the punishment of guilt. As, therefore, both these
functions seem to represent the majesty of God on earth, those
who were appointed to the royal or sacerdotal office were
anointed with oil. Furthermore, since Prophets, as the
interpreters and ambassadors of the immortal God, have unfolded
to us the secrets of heaven and by salutary precepts and the
prediction of future events have exhorted to amendment of life,
it was customary to anoint them also.</p>

<p> When Jesus Christ our Saviour came into the world, He assumed
these three characters of Prophet, Priest and King, and was
therefore called Christ, having been anointed for the discharge
of these functions, not by mortal hand or with earthly ointment,
but by the power of His heavenly Father and with a spiritual oil;
for the plenitude of the Holy Spirit and a more copious effusion
of all gifts than any other created being is capable of receiving
were poured into His soul. This the Prophet clearly indicates
when he addresses the Redeemer in these words: Thou hast loved
justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. The
same is also more explicitly declared by the Prophet Isaias: The
spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me:
he hath sent me to preach to the meek.</p>

<p> Jesus Christ, therefore, was the great Prophet and Teacher,
from whom we have learned the will of God and by whom the world
has been taught the knowledge of the heavenly Father. The name
prophet belongs to Him preeminently, because all others who were
dignified with that name were His disciples, sent principally to
announce the coming of that Prophet who was to save all men. </p>

<p> Christ was also a Priest, not indeed of the same order as
were the priests of the tribe of Levi in the Old Law, but of that
of which the Prophet David sang: Thou art a priest for ever
according to the order of Melchisedech. This subject the Apostle
fully and accurately develops in his Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>

<p> Christ not only as God, but also as man and partaker of our
nature, we acknowledge to be a King. Of Him the Angel testified:
He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. And of his kingdom
there shall be no end. This kingdom of Christ is spiritual and
eternal, begun on earth but perfected in heaven. He discharges by
His admirable Providence the duties of King towards His Church,
governing and protecting her against the assaults and snares of
her enemies, legislating for her and imparting to her not only
holiness and righteousness, but also the power and strength to
persevere. But although the good and the bad are found within the
limits of this kingdom, and thus all men by right belong to it,
yet those who in conformity with His commands lead unsullied and
innocent lives, experience beyond all others the sovereign
goodness and beneficence of our King. Although descended from the
most illustrious race of kings, He obtained this kingdom not by
hereditary or other human right, but because God bestowed on Him
as man all the power, dignity and majesty of which human nature
is capable. To Him, therefore, God delivered the government of
the whole world, and to this His sovereignty, which has already
commenced, all things shall be made fully and entirely subject on
the day of judgment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;His Only Son&quot;</h3>

<p>In these words, mysteries more exalted with regard to Jesus
are proposed to the faithful as objects of their belief and
contemplation; namely, that He is the Son of God, and true God,
like the Father who begot Him from eternity. We also confess that
He is the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, equal in all
things to the Father and the Holy Ghost; for in the Divine
Persons nothing unequal or unlike should exist, or even be
imagined to exist, since we acknowledge the essence, will and
power of all to be one. This truth is both clearly revealed in
many passages of Holy Scripture and sublimely announced in the
testimony of St. John: In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God. </p>

<p> But when we are told that Jesus is the Son of God, we are not
to understand anything earthly or mortal in His birth; but are
firmly to believe and piously to adore that birth by which, from
all eternity, the Father begot the Son, a mystery which reason
cannot fully conceive or comprehend, and at the contemplation of
which, overwhelmed, as it were, with admiration, we should
exclaim with the Prophet: Who shall declare his generation? On
this point, then, we are to believe that the Son is of the same
nature, of the same power and wisdom, with the Father, as we more
fully profess in these words of the Nicene Creed: And in one Lord
Jesus Christ, his Only­begotten Son, born of the Father before
all ages, God of God, light of light, true God of true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial to the Father, by whom all
things were made.</p>

<p> Among the different comparisons employed to elucidate the
mode and manner of this eternal generation that which is borrowed
from the production of thought in our mind seems to come nearest
to its illustration, and hence St. John calls the Son the Word.
For as our mind, in some sort understanding itself, forms an
image of itself, which theologians express by the term word, so
God, as far as we may compare human things to divine,
understanding Himself, begets the eternal Word. It is better,
however, to contemplate what faith proposes, and in the sincerity
of our souls to believe and confess that Jesus Christ is true God
and true Man, as God, begotten of the Father before all ages, as
Man, born in time of Mary, His Virgin Mother.</p>

<p> While we thus acknowledge His twofold Nativity; we believe
Him to be one Son, because His divine and human natures meet in
one Person. As to His divine generation He has no brethren or
coheirs, being the Only­begotten Son of the Father, while we
mortals are the work of His hands. But if we consider His birth
as man, He not only calls many by the name of brethren, but
treats them as such, since He admits them to share with Him the
glory of His paternal inheritance. They are those who by faith
have received Christ the Lord, and who really, and by works of
charity, show forth the faith which they profess in words. Hence
the Apostle calls Christ, the first­born amongst many brethren.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Our Lord&quot;</h3>

<p>Of our Saviour many things are recorded in Sacred Scripture.
Some of these, it is evident, apply to Him as God and some as
man, because from His two natures He received the different
properties which belong to both. Hence we say with truth that
Christ is Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, and these attributes He
has from His Divine Nature; again, we say of Him that He
suffered, died, and rose again, which are properties manifestly
that belong to His human nature.</p>

<p> Besides these terms, there are others common to both natures;
as when in this Article of the Creed we say our Lord. If, then,
this name applies to both natures, rightly is He to be called our
Lord. For as He, as well as the Father, is the eternal God, so is
He Lord of all things equally with the Father; and as He and the
Father are not the one, one God, and the other, another God, but
one and the same God, so likewise He and the Father are not the
one, one Lord, and the other, another Lord. </p>

<p> As man, He is also for many reasons appropriately called our
Lord. First, because He is our Redeemer, who delivered us from
sin, He deservedly acquired the power by which He truly is and is
called our Lord. This is the doctrine of the Apostle: </p>

<p> He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the
death of the cross. For which cause God also hath exalted him,
and hath given him a name which is above all names: that at the
name of Jesus every knee should bend, of those that are in
heaven, on earth, and under the earth: and that every tongue
should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God
the Father. And of Himself He said, after His Resurrection: All
power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</p>

<p> He is also called Lord because in one Person both natures,
the human and the divine, are united; and even though He had not
died for us, He would have yet deserved, by this admirable union,
to be constituted common Lord of all created things, particularly
of the faithful who obey and serve Him with all the fervour of
their souls.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Duties Owed To Christ Our Lord</h3>

<p>It remains, therefore, that the pastor remind the faithful
that: from Christ we take our name and are called Christians;
that we cannot be ignorant of the extent of His favours,
particularly since by His gift of faith we are enabled to
understand all these things. We, above all others, are under the
obligation of devoting and consecrating ourselves forever, like
faithful servants, to our Redeemer and our Lord.</p>

<p> This indeed, we promised at the doors of the church when
about to be baptised; for we then declared that we renounced the
devil and the world, and gave ourselves unreservedly to Jesus
Christ. But if to be enrolled as soldiers of Christ we
consecrated ourselves by so holy and solemn a profession to our
Lord, what punishments should we not deserve if after our
entrance into the Church, and after having known the will and
laws of God and received the grace of the Sacraments, we were to
form our lives upon the precepts and maxims of the world and the
devil, just as though when cleansed in the waters of Baptism, we
had pledged our fidelity to the world and to the devil, and not
to Christ the Lord and Saviour!</p>

<p> What heart so cold as not to be inflamed with love by the
kindness and good will exercised toward us by so great a Lord,
who, though holding us in His power and dominion as slaves
ransomed by His blood, yet embraces us with such ardent love as
to call us not servants, but friends and brethren? This,
assuredly, supplies the most just, and perhaps the strongest,
claim to induce us always to acknowledge, venerate, and adore Him
as our Lord. </p>
