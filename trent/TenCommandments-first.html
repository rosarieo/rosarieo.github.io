<h3>The First Commandment: &quot;<i>You shall have no other gods before Me</i>&quot;</h3>

<h3>THE FIRST COMMANDMENT : &quot;<i>I am the lord thy
god, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage. Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. Thou
shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of
those things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt
not adore them, nor serve them. I am the lord thy god, mighty,
jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and
showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
commandments</i>.&quot; </h3>

<h3>&quot;I am the Lord thy God&quot;</h3>

<p>The pastor should use his best endeavours to induce the
faithful to keep continually in view these words: I am the Lord
thy God. From them they will learn that their Lawgiver is none
other than their Creator, by whom they were made and are
preserved, and that they may truly repeat: He is the Lord our
God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his
hand. The frequent and earnest inculcation of these words will
also serve to induce the faithful more readily to observe the Law
and avoid sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Who Brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out
of the House of Bondage&quot;</h3>

<p>The next words, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out
of the house of bondage, seem to relate solely to the Jews
liberated from the bondage of Egypt. But if we consider the
meaning of the salvation of the entire human race, those words
are still more applicable to Christians, who are liberated by God
not from the bondage of Egypt, but from the slavery of sin and
the powers of darkness, and are translated into the kingdom of
his beloved Son. Contemplating the greatness of this favour,
Jeremias foretold: Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it
shall be said no more: The Lord liveth that brought forth. the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but: The Lord liveth
that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north
and out of all the lands to which I cast them out; and I will
bring them again into their land which gave to their fathers.
Behold, I send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish
them, etc. And, indeed, our most indulgent Father has gathered
together, through His beloved Son, His children that were
dispersed, that being made free from sin and made the servants of
justice, we may serve before him in holiness and justice all our
days.' </p>

<p> Against every temptation, therefore, the faithful should arm
themselves with these words of the Apostle as with a shield:
Shall we who are dead to sin live any longer therein? We are no
longer our own, we are His who died and rose again for us. He is
the Lord our God who has purchased us for Himself at the price of
His blood. Shall we then be any longer capable of sinning against
the Lord our God, and crucifying Him again? Being made truly
free, and with that liberty wherewith Christ has made us free,
let us, as we heretofore yielded our members to serve injustice,
henceforward yield them to serve justice to sanctification. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Thou shalt not have Strange Gods before
Me&quot;</h3>

<p>The pastor should teach that the first part of the Decalogue
contains our duties towards God; the second part, our duties
towards our neighbour. The reason (for this order) is that the
services we render our neighbour are rendered for the sake of
God; for then only do we love our neighbour as God commands when
we love him for God's sake. The Commandments which regard God are
those which were inscribed on the first table of the Law. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Above Words Contain A Command And A Prohibition </h3>

<p>(The pastor) should next show that the words just quoted
contain a twofold precept, the one mandatory, the other
prohibitory. When it is said: Thou shalt not have strange gods
before me, it is equivalent to saying: Thou shalt worship me the
true God; thou shalt not worship strange gods.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What They Command</h3>

<p>The (mandatory part) contains a precept of faith, hope and
charity. For, acknowledging God to be immovable, immutable,
always the same, we rightly confess that He is faithful and
entirely just. Hence in assenting to His oracles, we necessarily
yield to Him all belief and obedience. Again, who can contemplate
His omnipotence, His clemency, His willing beneficence, and not
repose in Him all his hopes? Finally, who can behold the riches
of His goodness and love, which He lavishes on us, and not love
Him? Hence the exordium and the conclusion used by God in
Scripture when giving His commands: I, the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What They Forbid</h3>

<p>The (negative) part of this Commandment is comprised in these
words: Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. This the
Lawgiver subjoins, not because it is not sufficiently expressed
in the affirmative part of the precept, which means: Thou shalt
worship me, the only God, for if He is God, He is the only God;
but on account of the blindness of many who of old professed to
worship the true God and yet adored a multitude of gods. Of these
there were many even among the Hebrews, whom Elias reproached
with having halted between two sides, and also among the
Samaritans, who worshipped the God of Israel and the gods of the
nations. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Commandment</h3>

<p>After this it should be added that this is the first and
principal Commandment, not only in order, but also in its nature,
dignity and excellence. God is entitled to infinitely greater
love and obedience from us than any lord or king. He created us,
He governs us, He nurtured us even in the womb, brought us into
the world, and still supplies us with all the necessaries of life
and maintenance. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sins Against This Commandment</h3>

<p>Against this Commandment all those sin who have not faith.
hope and charity. such sinners are very numerous, for they
include all who fall into heresy, who reject what holy mother the
Church proposes for our belief, who give credit to dreams.
fortuneÂ­telling, and such illusions; those who, despairing of
salvation, trust not in the goodness of God; and those who rely
solely on wealth, or health and strength of body. But these
matters are developed more at length in treatises on sins and
vices.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Veneration And Invocation Of Angels And Saints Not
Forbidden By This Commandment</h3>

<p>In explanation of this Commandment it should be accurately
taught that the veneration and invocation of holy Angels and of
the blessed who now enjoy the glory of heaven, and likewise the
honour which the Catholic Church has always paid even to the
bodies and ashes of the Saints, are not forbidden by this
Commandment. If a king ordered that no one else should set
himself up as king, or accept the honours due to the royal
person, who would be so foolish as to infer that the sovereign
was unwilling that suitable honour and respect should be paid to
his magistrates? Now although Christians follow the example set
by the Saints of the Old Law, and are said to adore the Angels,
yet they do not give to Angels that honour which is due to God
alone.</p>

<p> And if we sometimes read that Angels refused to be worshipped
by men, we are to know that they did so because the worship which
they refused to accept was the honour due to God alone.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>It Is Lawful To Honour And Invoke The Angels </h3>

<p>The Holy Spirit who says: Honour and glory to God alone,
commands us also to honour our parents and elders; and the holy
men who adored one God only are also said in Scripture to have
adored, that is, supplicated and venerated kings. If then kings,
by whose agency God governs the world, are so highly honoured,
shall it be deemed unlawful to honour those angelic spirits whom
God has been pleased to constitute His ministers, whose services
He makes use of not only in the government of His Church, but
also of the universe, by whose aid, although we see them not, we
are every day delivered from the greatest dangers of soul and
body ? Are they not worthy of far greater honour, since their
dignity so far surpasses that of kings?</p>

<p> Add to this their love towards us, which, as we easily see
from Scripture, prompts them to pour out their prayers for those
countries over which they are placed, as well as for us whose
guardians they are, and whose prayers and tears they present
before the throne of God Hence our Lord admonishes us in the
Gospel not to offend the little ones because their angels in
heaven always see the face of their Father who is in heaven.</p>

<p> Their Intercession, therefore, we ought to invoke, because
they always see tile face of God, and are constituted by Him the
willing advocates of our salvation. The Scriptures bear witness
to such invocation. Jacob entreated the Angel with whom he
wrestled to bless him; nay, he even compelled him, declaring that
he would not let him go until he had blessed him. And not only
did he invoke the blessing of the Angel whom he saw, but also of
him whom he saw not. The angel, said he, who delivers me from all
evils, bless these boys.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>It Is Lawful To Honour And Invoke The Saints </h3>

<p>From all this we may conclude that to honour the Saints who
nave slept in the Lord, to invoke them, and to venerate their
sacred relics and ashes, far from diminishing, tends considerably
to increase the glory of God, in proportion as man's hope is thus
animated and fortified, and he himself encouraged to imitate the
Saints.</p>

<p> This is a practice which is also supported by the authority'
of the second Council of Nice, the Councils of Gangra, and of
Trent, and by the testimony of the Fathers. In order, however,
that the pastor may be the better prepared to meet the objections
of those who deny this doctrine, he should consult particularly
St. Jerome against Vigilantius and St. Damascene. To the teaching
of these Fathers should be added as a consideration of prime
importance that the practice was received from the Apostles, and
has always been retained and preserved in the Church of God.</p>

<p> But who can desire a stronger or more convincing proof than
that which is supplied by the admirable praises given in
Scripture to the Saints? For there are not wanting eulogies which
God Himself pronounced on some of the Saints. If, then, Holy Writ
celebrates their praises, why should not men show them singular
honour ? </p>

<p> A stronger claim which the Saints have to be honoured and
invoked is that they constantly pray for our salvation and obtain
for us by their merits and influence many blessings from God. If
there is joy in heaven over the conversion of one sinner, will
not the citizens of heaven assist those who repent? When they are
invoked, will they not obtain for us the pardon of sins, and the
grace of God ?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Objections Answered</h3>

<p>Should it be said, as some say, that the patronage of the
Saints is unnecessary, because God hears our prayers without the
intervention of a mediator, this impious assertion is easily met
by the observation of St. Augustine: There are many things which
God does not grant without a mediator and intercessor. This is
confirmed by the wellÂ­known examples of Abimelech and the
friends of Job who were pardoned only through the prayers of
Abraham and of Job</p>

<p> Should it be alleged that to recur to the patronage and
intercession of the Saints argues want or weakness of faith, what
will (the objectors) answer regarding the centurion whose faith
was highly eulogised by the Lord God Himself, despite the fact
that he had sent to the Redeemer the ancients of the Jews, to
intercede for his sick servant?</p>

<p> True, there is but one Mediator, Christ the Lord, who alone
has reconciled us to the heavenly Father through His blood, and
who, having obtained eternal redemption, and having entered once
into the holies, ceases not to intercede for us. But it by no
means follows that it is therefore unlawful to have recourse to
the intercession of the Saints. If, because we have one Mediator
Jesus Christ, it were unlawful to ask the intercession of the
Saints, the Apostle would never have recommended himself with so
much earnestness to the prayers of his brethren on earth. For the
prayers of the living would lessen the glory and dignity of
Christ's Mediatorship not less than the intercession of the
Saints in heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Honour And Invocation Of Saints Is Approved By
Miracles </h3>

<p>But who would not be convinced of the honour due the Saints
and of the help they give us by the wonders wrought at their
tombs? Diseased eyes, hands, and other members are restored to
health; the dead are raised to life, and demons are expelled from
the bodies of men ! These are facts which St. Ambrose and St.
Augustine, most unexceptionable witnesses, declare in their
writings, not that they heard, as many did, nor that they read,
as did manÂ­ very reliable men, but that they saw.</p>

<p> But why multiply proofs? If the clothes, the handkerchiefs,
and even the very shadows of the Saints, while yet on earth,
banished disease and restored health, who will have the hardihood
to deny that God can still work the same wonders by the holy
ashes, the bones and other relics of the Saints ? Of this we have
a proof in the restoration to life of the dead body which was
accidentally let down into the grave of Eliseus, and which, on
touching the body (of the Prophet), was instantly restored to
life.</p>

<p> <b>&quot;Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the
earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under
the earth: thou shalt not adore them nor serve them&quot; </p>

<p> </b> Some, supposing these words which come next in order to
constitute a distinct precept, reduce the ninth and tenth
Commandments to one. St. Augustine, on the contrary, considering
the last two to be distinct Commandments, makes the words just
quoted a part of the first Commandment. His division is much
approved in the Church, and hence we willingly adopt it.
Furthermore, a very good reason for this arrangement at once
suggests itself. It was fitting that to the first Commandment
should be added the rewards or punishments entailed by each one
of the Commandments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Above Words Do Not Forbid All Images</h3>

<p>Let no one think that this Commandment entirely forbids the
arts of painting, engraving or sculpture. The Scriptures inform
us that God Himself commanded to be made images of Cherubim, and
also the brazen serpent. The interpretation, therefore, at which
we must arrive, is that images are prohibited only inasmuch as
they are used as deities to receive adoration, and so to injure
the true worship of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>They Forbid Idols And Representations Of The Deity</h3>

<p>As far as this Commandment is concerned, it is clear that
there are two chief ways in which God's majesty can be seriously
outraged. The first way is by worshipping idols and images as
God, or believing that they possess any divinity or virtue
entitling them to our worship, by praying to, or reposing
confidence in them, as the Gentiles did, who placed their hopes
in idols, and whose idolatry the Scriptures frequently condemn.
The other way is by attempting to form a representation of the
Deity, as if He were visible to mortal eyes, or could be
reproduced by colours or figures. Who, says Damascene, can
represent God, invisible, as He is, incorporeal, uncircumscribed
by limits, and incapable of being reproduced under any shape.
This subject is treated more at large in the second Council of
Nice. Rightly, then, did the Apostles say (of the Gentiles): They
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into a likeness of
birds, and of fourÂ­footed beasts, and of creeping things; for
they worshipped all these things as God, seeing that they made
the images of these things to represent Him. Hence the
Israelites, when they exclaimed before the image of the calf:
These are thy gods, Israel, that have brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, are denounced as idolaters, because they changed
their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.</p>

<p> When, therefore, the Lord had forbidden the worship of
strange gods, He also forbade the making of an image of the Deity
from brass or other materials, in order thus utterly to do away
with idolatry. It is this that Isaias declares when he asks: To
whom then have you likened God, or what image will you make for
hill? That this is the meaning of the prohibition contained in
the Commandment is proved, not only from the writings of the holy
Fathers, who, as may be seen in the seventh General Council, give
to it this interpretation: but is also clearly declared in these
words of Deuteronomy, by which Moses sought to withdraw the
people from the worship of idols: You saw not, he says, any
similitude in the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb, from
the midst of the fire. These words this wisest of legislators
spoke, lest through error of any sort, they should make an image
of the Deity, and transfer to any thing created, the honour due
to God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>They Do Not Forbid Representations Of The Divine
Persons And Angels</h3>

<p>To represent the Persons of the Holy Trinity by certain forms
under which they appeared in the Old and New Testaments no one
should deem contrary to religion or the law of God. For who can
be so ignorant as to believe that such forms are representations
of the Deity? Â­Â­ forms, as the pastor should teach, which only
express some attribute or action ascribed to God. Thus when from
the description of Daniel God is painted as the Ancient of days,
seated on a throne, with the books opened before hint, the
eternity of God is represented and also the infinite wisdom, by
which He sees and judges all the thoughts and actions of men.' </p>

<p> Angels, also, are represented under human form and with wings
to give us to understand that they are actuated by benevolent
feelings towards mankind, and are always prepared to execute the
Lord's commands; for they are all ministering spirits, sent to
minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation.
</p>

<p> What attributes of the Holy Ghost are represented under the
forms of a dove, and of tongues of fire, in the Gospel and in the
Acts of the Apostles, is a matter too well known to require
lengthy explanation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>They Do Not Forbid Images Of Christ And The Saints </h3>

<p>But to make and honour the images of Christ our Lord, of His
holy and virginal Mother, and of the Saints, all of whom were
clothed with human nature and appeared in human form, is not only
not forbidden by this Commandment, but has always been deemed a
holy practice and a most sure indication of gratitude. This
position is confirmed by the monuments of the Apostolic age, the
General Councils of the Church, and the writings of so many among
the Fathers, eminent alike for sanctity and learning, all of whom
are of one accord upon the subject.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Usefulness Of Sacred Images</h3>

<p>But the pastor should not content himself with showing that it
is lawful to have images in churches, and to pay them honour and
respect, since this respect is referred to their prototypes. He
should also show that the uninterrupted observance of this
practice down to the present day has been attended with great
advantage to the faithful, as may be seen in the work of
Damascene on images, and in the seventh General Council, the
second of Nice. </p>

<p> But as the enemy of mankind, by his wiles and deceits, seeks
to pervert even the most holy institutions, should the faithful
happen at all to offend in this particular, the pastor, in
accordance with the decree of the Council of Trent's should use
every exertion in his power to correct such an abuse, and, if
necessary, explain the decree itself to the people.</p>

<p> He will also inform the unlettered and those who may be
ignorant of the use of images, that they are intended to instruct
in the history of the Old and New Testaments, and to revive from
time to time their memory; that thus, moved by the contemplation
of heavenly things, we may be the more ardently inflamed to adore
and love God Himself. He should, also, point out that the images
of the Saints are placed in churches, not only to be honoured,
but also that they may admonish us by their examples to imitate
their lives and virtues.</p>

<p> <b>&quot;I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and
fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto
thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.&quot; </p>

<p> </b> In this concluding clause of this Commandment two things
occur which demand careful exposition. The first is, that while,
on account of the enormous guilt incurred by the violation of the
first Commandment, and the propensity of man towards its
violation, the punishment is properly indicated in this place, it
is also attached to all the other Commandments.</p>

<p> Every law enforces its observance by rewards and punishments;
and hence the frequent and numerous promises of God in Sacred
Scripture. To omit those that we meet almost on every page of the
Old Testament, it is written in the Gospel: If thou wilt enter
into life, keep the commandments; and again: He that doth the
will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; and also: Every tree that doth not yield good
fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire; Whosoever is
angry with his brother shall be guilty of the judgment; If you
will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your
offences.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How The Sanction Contained In The Above Words Should
Be Proposed </h3>

<p>The other observation is that this concluding part (of the
Commandment) is to be proposed in a very different manner to the
spiritual and to the carnal Christian. To the spiritual who is
animated by the Spirit of God, and who yields to Him a willing
and cheerful obedience, it is, in some sort, glad tidings and a
strong proof of the divine goodness towards him. In it he
recognises the care of his most loving God, who, now by rewards,
now by punishments, almost compels His creatures to adore and
worship Him. The spiritual man acknowledges the infinite goodness
of God towards himself in vouchsafing to issue His commands to
him and to make use of his service to the glory of the divine
name. And not only does he acknowledge the divine goodness, he
also cherishes a strong hope that when God commands what He
pleases, He will also give strength to fulfil hat He commands.</p>

<p> But to the carnal man, who is not yet freed from a servile
spirit and who abstains from sin more through fear of punishment
than love of virtue, (this sanction) of the divine law, which
closes each of the Commandments, is burdensome and severe.
Wherefore they should be encouraged by pious exhortation, and led
by the hand, as it were, in the way of the law. The pastor,
therefore, as often as he has occasion to explain any of the
Commandments should keep this in view.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Mighty</h3>

<p>But both the carnal and the spiritual should be spurred on,
especially by two considerations which are contained in this
concluding clause, and are highly calculated to enforce obedience
to the divine law. </p>

<p> The one is that God is called the strong. That appellation
needs to be fully expounded; because the flesh, unappalled by the
terrors of the divine menaces, frequently indulges in the foolish
expectation of escaping, in one way or another, God's wrath and
threatened punishment. But when one is deeply impressed with the
conviction that God is the strong, he will exclaim with the great
David: Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I pee
from thy face?</p>

<p> The flesh, also, distrusting the promises of God, sometimes
magnifies the power of the enemy to such an extent, as to believe
itself unable to withstand his assaults; while, on the contrary,
a firm and unshaken faith, which wavers not, but relies
confidently on the strength and power of God, animates and
confirms man. For it says: The Lord is my light and my salvation;
whom shall I fear? </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Jealous</h3>

<p>The second spur is the jealousy of God. Man is sometimes
tempted to think that God takes no interest in human affairs, and
does not even care whether we observe or neglect His law. This
error is the source of the great disorders of life. But when we
believe that God is a jealous God, the thought easily keeps us
within the limits of our duty.</p>

<p> The jealousy attributed to God does not, however, imply
disturbance of mind; it is that divine love and charity by which
God will suffer no human creature to be unfaithful to Him with
impunity, and which destroys all those who are disloyal to Him.
The jealousy of God, therefore, is the most tranquil and
impartial justice, which repudiates as an adulteress the soul
corrupted by. erroneous opinions and criminal passions.</p>

<p> This jealousy of God, since it shows His boundless and
incomprehensible goodness towards us, we find most sweet and
pleasant. Among men there is no love more ardent, no greater or
more intimate tie, than that of those who are united by marriage.
Hence when God frequently compares Himself to a spouse or husband
and calls Himself a jealous God, He shows the excess of His love
towards us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Zeal In The Service Of God</h3>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should here teach that men should be so
warmly interested in promoting the worship and honour of God as
to be said rather to be jealous of Him than to love Him, in
imitation of Him who says of Himself: With zeal have I been
zealous for the Lord God of hosts, or rather of Christ Himself,
who says: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Visiting The Iniquity,&quot; Etc.</h3>

<p>Concerning the threat contained in this Commandment it should
be explained that God will not suffer sinners to go unpunished,
but will chastise them as a father, or punish them with the
rigour and severity of a judge. This was elsewhere explained by
Moses when he said: Thou shalt know that the Lord thy God is a
strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them
that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a
thousand generations; and repaying forthwith them that hate him.
You will not, says Josue, be able to serve the Lord; for he is a
holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your
wickedness and sins. If you leave the Lord and serve strange
gods, he will turn and will afflict you, and will destroy you.</p>

<p> The faithful are also to be taught that the punishments here
threatened await the third and fourth generation of the impious
and wicked; not that the children are always chastised for the
sins of their ancestors, but that while these and their children
may go unpunished, their posterity shall not all escape the wrath
and vengeance of the Almighty. This happened in the case of King
Josias. God had spared him for his singular piety, and allowed
him to be gathered to the tomb of his fathers in peace, that his
eyes might not behold the evils of the times that were to befall
Juda and Jerusalem, on account of the wickedness of his
grandfather Manasses; yet, after his death the divine vengeance
so overtook his posterity that even the children of Josias were
not spared. </p>

<p> How the words of this Commandment are not at variance with
the statement of the Prophet: The soul that sins shall die, is
clearly shown by the authority of St. Gregory, supported by the
testimony of all the ancient Fathers. Whoever, he says, follows
the bad example of a wicked father is also bound by his sins; but
he who does not follow the example of his father, shall not at
all suffer for the sins of the father Hence it follows that a
wicked son, who dreads not to add his own malice to the vices of
his father, by which he knows the divine wrath to have been
excited, pays the penalty not only of his own sins, but also of
those of his father. It is just that he who dreads not to walk in
the footsteps of a wicked father, in presence of a rigorous
judge, should be compelled in the present life to expiate the
crimes of his wicked parent.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;And Showing Mercy, Etc.</h3>

<p>The pastor should next observe that the goodness and mercy of
God far exceed His justice. He is angry to the third and fourth
generation; but He bestows His mercy on thousands. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Of Them That Hate Me&quot;</h3>

<p>The words of them that hate me display the grievousness of
sin. What more wicked, what more detestable than to hate God, the
supreme goodness and sovereign truth? This, however, is the crime
of all sinners; for as he that hath God's commandments and
keepeth them, loveth God, so he who despises His law and violates
His Commandments, is justly said to hate God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Of Them That Love Me</h3>

<p>The concluding words: And to them that love me, point out the
manner and motive of observing the law. Those who obey the law of
God must needs be influenced in its observance by the same love
and charity which they bear to God, a principle which should be
brought to mind in the instructions on all the other
Commandments. </p>
