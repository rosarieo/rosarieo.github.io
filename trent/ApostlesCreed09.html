<h3><center>ARTICLE IX : &quot;I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY
CATHOLIC CHURCH; THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>The Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>With what great diligence pastors ought to explain to the
faithful the truth of this ninth Article will be easily seen, if
we attend chiefly to two considerations.</p>

<p> First, as St. Augustine observes, the Prophets spoke more
plainly and openly of the Church than of Christ, foreseeing that
on this a much greater number may err and be deceived than on the
mystery of the Incarnation. For in after ages there would not be
wanting wicked men who, like the ape that would fain pass for a
man, would claim that they alone were Catholics, and with no less
impiety than effrontery assert that with them alone is the
Catholic Church. </p>

<p> The second consideration is that he whose mind is strongly
impressed with the truth taught in this Article, will easily
escape the awful danger of heresy. For a person is not to be
called a heretic as soon as he shall have offended in matters of
faith; but he is a heretic who, having disregarded the authority
of the Church, maintains impious opinions with pertinacity.
Since, therefore, it is impossible that anyone be infected with
the contagion of heresy, so long as he holds what this Article
proposes to be believed, let pastors use every diligence that the
faithful, having known this mystery and guarded against the wiles
of Satan, may persevere in the true faith.</p>

<p> This Article hinges upon the preceding one; for, it having
been already shown that the Holy Ghost is the source and giver of
all holiness, we here profess our belief that the Church has been
endowed by Him with sanctity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Part Of This Article : &quot;I Believe In The
Holy Catholic Church</h3>

<p>The Latins, having borrowed the word ecclesia (church) from
the Greeks, have transferred it, since the preaching of the
Gospel, to sacred things. It becomes necessary, therefore, to
explain its meaning.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Church&quot;</h3>

<p>The word ecclesia (church) means a calling forth. But writers
afterward used it to signify a meeting or assembly, whether the
people gathered together were members of a true or of a false
religion. Thus in the Acts it is written of the people of Ephesus
that when the town­clerk had appeased a tumultuous assemblage he
said: And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be
decided in a lawful church. The Ephesians, who were worshippers
of Diana, are thus called a lawful church (ecclesia). Nor are the
Gentiles only, who knew not God, called a church (ecclesia); by
the same name at times are also designated the councils of wicked
and impious men. I have hated the church (ecclesiam) of the
malignant, says the Prophet, and with the wicked I will not sit.</p>

<p> In common Scripture usage, however, the word was subsequently
employed to signify the Christian society only, and the
assemblies of the faithful; that is, of those who are called by
faith to the light of truth and the knowledge of God, that,
having forsaken the darkness of ignorance and error, they may
worship the living and true God piously and holily, and serve Him
from their whole heart. In a word, The Church, says St.
Augustine, consists of the faithful dispersed throughout the
world.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Mysteries Which The Word Church Comprises</h3>

<p>In this word are contained important mysteries. For, in the
calling forth, which it signifies, we recognise at once the
benignity and splendour of divine grace, and we understand that
the Church is very unlike all other societies. Other bodies rest
on human reason and prudence, but the Church reposes on the
wisdom and counsels of God who has called us inwardly by the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, who opens the hearts of men; and
outwardly, through the labor and ministry of pastors and
preachers.</p>

<p> Moreover, the end of this vocation, that is, the knowledge
and possession of things eternal will be at once understood if we
but remember why the faithful of the Old Law were called a
Synagogue, that is, a flock for, as St. Augustine teaches, they
were so called, because, like cattle, which are wont to herd
together. they looked only to terrestrial and transitory goods.
Wherefore, the Christian people are justly called, not a
Synagogue, but a Church, because, despising earthly and passing
things, they pursue only things heavenly and eternal.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Names Given The Church In Scripture</h3>

<p>Many names, moreover, which are replete with mysteries, have
been used to designate the Christian body. Thus, by the Apostle,
it is called the house and edifice of God. If, says he to
Timothy, I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the
living God, the pillar and ground of truth. The Church is called
a house, because it is, as it were, one family governed by one
father of the family, and enjoying a community of all spiritual
goods.</p>

<p> It is also called the flock of the sheep of Christ, of which
He is the door and the shepherd. It is called the spouse of
Christ. I have espoused you to one husband, says the Apostle to
the Corinthians, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to
Christ; and to the Ephesians: Husbands love your wives, as Christ
also loved the church; and of marriage: This is a great
sacrament, but I speak in Christ and in the church.</p>

<p> Finally, the Church is called the body of Christ, as may be
seen in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians. Each of
these appellations has very great influence in exciting the
faithful to prove themselves worthy of the boundless clemency and
goodness of God, who chose them to be the people of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Parts of the Church</h3>

<p>These things having been explained, it will be necessary to
enumerate the several component parts of the Church, and to point
out their difference, in order that the faithful may the better
comprehend the nature, properties, gifts, and graces of God's
beloved Church, and by reason of them unceasingly praise the most
holy name of God.</p>

<p> The Church consists principally of two parts, the one called
the Church triumphant; the other, the Church militant. The Church
triumphant is that most glorious and happy assemblage of blessed
spirits, and of those who have triumphed over the world, the
flesh, and the iniquity of Satan, and are now exempt and safe
from the troubles of this life and enjoy everlasting bliss. The
Church militant is the society of all the faithful still dwelling
on earth. It is called militant, because it wages eternal war
with those implacable enemies, the world, the flesh and the
devil. </p>

<p> We are not, however, to infer that there are two Churches.
The Church triumphant and the Church militant are two constituent
parts of one Church; one part going before, and now in the
possession of its heavenly country; the other, following every
day, until at length, united with our Saviour, it shall repose in
endless felicity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Members Of The Church Militant</h6>

<p> The Church militant is composed of two classes of persons,
the good and the bad, both professing the same faith and
partaking of the same Sacraments, yet differing in their manner
of life and morality.</p>

<p> The good are those who are linked together not only by the
profession of the same faith, and the participation of the same
Sacraments, but also by the spirit of grace and the bond of
charity. Of these St. Paul says: The Lord knoweth who are his.
Who they are that compose this class we also may remotely
conjecture, but we can by no means pronounce with certainty.
Hence Christ the Saviour does not speak of this portion of His
Church when He refers us to the Church and commands us to hear
and to obey her. As this part of the Church is unknown, how could
we ascertain with certainty whose decision to recur to, whose
authority to obey?</p>

<p> The Church, therefore, as the Scriptures and the writings of
the Saints testify, includes within her fold the good and the
bad; and it was in this sense that St. Paul spoke of one body and
one spirit. Thus understood, the Church is known and is compared
to a city built on a mountain, and visible from every side. As
all must yield obedience to her authority, it is necessary that
she may­be known by all.</p>

<p> That the Church is composed of the good and the bad we learn
from many parables contained in the Gospel. Thus, the kingdom of
heaven, that is, the Church militant, is compared to a net cast
into the sea, to a field in which tares were sown with the good
grain, to a threshing floor on which the grain is mixed up with
the chaff, and also to ten virgins, some of whom were wise, and
some foolish. And long before, we trace a figure and resemblance
of this Church in the ark of Noah, which contained not only
clean, but also unclean animals.</p>

<p> But although the Catholic faith uniformly and truly teaches
that the good and the bad belong to the Church, yet the same
faith declares that the condition of both is very different. The
wicked are contained in the Church, as the chaff is mingled with
the grain on the threshing floor, or as dead members sometimes
remain attached to a living body.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Those Who Are Not Members Of The Church</h6>

<p> Hence there are but three classes of persons excluded from
the Church's pale: infidels, heretics and schismatics, and
excommunicated persons. Infidels are outside the Church because
they never belonged to, and never knew the Church, and were never
made partakers of any of her Sacraments. Heretics and schismatics
are excluded from the Church, because they have separated from
her and belong to her only as deserters belong to the army from
which they have deserted. It is not, however, to be denied that
they are still subject to the jurisdiction of the Church,
inasmuch as they may be called before her tribunals, punished and
anathematised. Finally, excommunicated persons are not members of
the Church, because they have been cut off by her sentence from
the number of her children and belong not to her communion until
they repent. </p>

<p> But with regard to the rest, however wicked and evil they may
be, it is certain that they still belong to the Church: Of this
the faithful are frequently to be reminded, in order to be
convinced that, were even the lives of her ministers debased by
crime, they are still within the Church, and therefore lose
nothing of their power.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Uses of the Word &quot;Church&quot;</h3>

<p>Portions of the Universal Church are usually called churches,
as when the Apostle mentions the Church at Corinth, at Galatia,
of the Laodiceans, of the Thessalonians.</p>

<p> The private families of the faithful he also calls churches.
The church in the family of Priscilla and Aquila he commands to
be saluted; and in another place, he says: Aquila and Priscilla
with the church that is in their house salute you much in the
Lord. Writing to Philemon, he makes use of the same word.</p>

<p> Sometimes, also, the word church is used to signify the
prelates and pastors of the church. If he will not hear thee,
says our Lord, tell the church. Here the word church means the
authorities of the­Church.</p>

<p> The place in which the faithful assemble to hear the Word of
God, or for other religious purposes, is also called a church.
But in this Article, the word church is specially used to signify
both the good and the bad, the governed, as well as the
governing. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Marks Of The Church</h3>

<p>The distinctive marks of the Church are also to be made known
to the faithful, that thus they may be enabled to estimate the
extent of the blessing conferred by God on those who have had the
happiness to be born and educated within her pale.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>&quot;One'</h6>

<p> The first mark of the true Church is described in the Nicene
Creed, and consists in unity: My dove is one, my beautiful one is
one. So vast a multitude, scattered far and wide, is called one
for the reasons mentioned by St. Paul in his Epistle to the
Ephesians: One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Unity In Government</h6>

<p> The Church has but one ruler and one governor, the invisible
one, Christ, whom the eternal Father hath made head over all the
Church, which is his body; the visible one, the Pope, who, as
legitimate successor of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, fills
the Apostolic chair.</p>

<p> It is the unanimous teaching of the Fathers that this visible
head is necessary to establish and preserve unity in the Church.
This St. Jerome clearly perceived and as clearly expressed when,
in his work against Jovinian, he wrote: One is elected that, by
the appointment of a head, all occasion of schism may be removed.
In his letter to Pope Damasus the same holy Doctor writes: Away
with envy, let the ambition of Roman grandeur cease! I speak to
the successor of the fisherman, and to the disciple of the cross.
Following no chief but Christ, I am united in communion with your
Holiness, that is, with the chair of Peter. I know that on that
rock is built the Church. Whoever will eat the lamb outside this
house is profane; whoever is not in the ark of Noah shall perish
in the .flood.</p>

<p> The same doctrine was long before established by Saints
Irenaeus and Cyprian. The latter, speaking of the unity of the
Church observes: The Lord said to Peter, I say to thee, Peter!
thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my Church. He
builds His Church on one. And although after His Resurrection He
gave equal power to all His Apostles, saying: As the Father hath
sent me, I also send you, receive ye the Holy Ghost; yet to make
unity more manifest, He decided by His own authority that it
should be derived from one alone, etc.</p>

<p> Again, Optatus of Milevi says: You cannot be excused on the
score of ignorance, knowing as you do that in the city of Rome
the episcopal chair was first conferred on Peter, who occupied it
as head of the Apostles; in order that in that one chair the
unity of the Church might be preserved by all, and that the other
Apostles might not claim each a chair for himself; so that now he
who erects another in opposition to this single chair is a
schismatic and a prevaricator.</p>

<p> Later on St. Basil wrote: Peter is made the foundation,
because he says: Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God; and
hears in reply that he is a rock. But although a rock, he is not
such a rock as Christ; for Christ is truly an immovable rock, but
Peter, only by virtue of that rock. For Jesus bestows His
dignities on others; He is a priest, and He makes priests; a
rock, and He makes a rock; what belongs to Himself, He bestows on
His servants.</p>

<p> Lastly, St. Ambrose says: Because he alone of all of them
professed (Christ) he was placed above all.</p>

<p> Should anyone object that the Church is content with one Head
and one Spouse, Jesus Christ, and requires no other, the answer
is obvious. For as we deem Christ not only the author of all the
Sacraments, but also their invisible minister ­­ He it is who
baptises, He it is who absolves, although men are appointed by
Him the external ministers of the Sacraments ­­ so has He
placed over His Church, which He governs by His invisible Spirit,
a man to be His vicar and the minister of His power. A visible
Church requires a visible head; therefore the Saviour appointed
Peter head and pastor of all the faithful, when He committed to
his care the feeding of all His sheep, in such ample terms that
He willed the very same power of ruling and governing the entire
Church to descend to Peter's successors.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Unity In Spirit, Hope And Faith</h6>

<p> Moreover, the Apostle, writing to the Corinthians, tells them
that there is but one and the same Spirit who imparts grace to
the faithful, as the soul communicates life to the members of the
body. Exhorting the Ephesians to preserve this unity, he says: Be
careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; one
body and one Spirit. As the human body consists of many members,
animated by one soul, which gives sight to the eves, hearing to
the ears, and to the other senses the power of discharging their
respective functions; so the mystical body of Christ, which is
the Church, is composed of many faithful. The hope, to which we
are called, is also one, as the Apostle tells us in the same
place; for we all hope for the same consummation, eternal and
happy life. Finally, the faith which all are bound to believe and
to profess is one: Let there be no schisms amongst you, says the
Apostle. And Baptism, which is the seal of our Christian faith,
is also one.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>&quot;Holy&quot;</h6>

<p> The second mark of the Church is holiness, as we learn from
these words of the Prince of the Apostles: You are a chosen
generation, a holy nation.</p>

<p> The Church is called holy because she is consecrated and
dedicated to God; for so other things when set apart and
dedicated to the worship of God were wont to be called holy, even
though they were material. Examples of this in the Old Law were
vessels, vestments and altars. In the same sense the first­born
who were dedicated to the Most High God were also called holy.</p>

<p> It should not be deemed a matter of surprise that the Church,
although numbering among her children many sinners, is called
holy. For as those who profess any art, even though they depart
from its rules, are still called artists, so in like manner the
faithful, although offending in many things and violating the
engagements to which they had pledged themselves, are still
called holy, because they have been made the people of God and
have consecrated themselves to Christ by faith and Baptism.
Hence, St. Paul calls the Corinthians sanctified and holy,
although it is certain that among them there were some whom he
severely rebuked as carnal, and also charged with grosser crimes.</p>

<p> The Church is also to be called holy because she is united to
her holy Head, as His body; that is, to Christ the Lord,' the
fountain of all holiness, from whom flow the graces of the Holy
Spirit and the riches of the divine bounty. St. Augustine,
interpreting these words of the Prophet: Preserve my soul, for I
am holy,&quot; thus admirably expresses himself: Let the body of
Christ boldly say, let also that one man, exclaiming from the
ends of the earth, boldly say, with his Head, and under his Head,
I am holy; for he received the grace of holiness, the grace of
Baptism and of remission of sins. And a little further on: If all
Christians and all the faithful, having been baptised in Christ,
have put Him on, according to these words of the Apostle:
&quot;As many of you as have been baptised in Christ, have put on
Christ&quot;; if they are made members of his body, and yet say
they are not holy, they do an injury to their Head, whose members
are holy. </p>

<p> Moreover, the Church alone has the legitimate worship of
sacrifice, and the salutary use of the Sacraments, which are the
efficacious instruments of divine grace, used by God to produce
true holiness. Hence, to possess true holiness, we must belong to
this Church. The Church therefore it is clear, is holy, and holy
because she is the body of Christ, by whom she is sanctified, and
in whose blood she is washed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>&quot;Catholic&quot;</h6>

<p> The third mark of the Church is that she is Catholic; that
is, universal. And justly is she called Catholic, because, as St.
Augustine says, she is diffused by the splendour of one faith
from the rising to the setting sun.&quot;</p>

<p> Unlike states of human institution, or the sects of heretics,
she is not confined to any one country or class of men, but
embraces within the amplitude of her love all mankind, whether
barbarians or Scythians, slaves or freemen, male or female.
Therefore it is written: Thou . . . hast redeemed us to God, in
thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and
nation, and hast made us to our God a kingdom. Speaking of the
Church, David says: Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles
for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy
possession; and also, I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon
knowing me; and man is born in her.</p>

<p> Moreover to this Church, built upon the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, belong all the faithful who have existed
from Adam to the present day, or who shall exist, in the
profession of the true faith, to the end of time; all of whom are
founded and raised upon the one corner­stone, Christ, who made
both one, and announced peace to them that are near and to them
that are far.</p>

<p> She is also called universal, because all who desire eternal
salvation must cling to and embrace her, like those who entered
the ark to escape perishing in the flood.. This (note of
catholicity), therefore, is to be taught as a most reliable
criterion, by which to distinguish the true from a false Church. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Apostolic</h6>

<p> The true Church is also to be recognised from her origin,
which can be traced back under the law of grace to the Apostles;
for her doctrine is the truth not recently given, nor now first
heard of, but delivered of old by the Apostles, and disseminated
throughout the entire world. Hence no one can doubt that the
impious opinions which heresy invents, opposed as they are to the
doctrines taught by the Church from the days of the Apostles to
the present time, are very different from the faith of the true
Church.</p>

<p> That all, therefore, might know which was the Catholic
Church, the Fathers, guided by the Spirit of God, added to the
Creed the word Apostolic. For the Holy Ghost, who presides over
the Church, governs her by no other ministers than those of
Apostolic succession. This Spirit, first imparted to the
Apostles, has by the infinite goodness of God always continued in
the Church. And just as this one Church cannot err in faith or
morals, since it is guided by the Holy Ghost; so, on the
contrary, all other societies arrogating to themselves the name
of church, must necessarily, because guided by the spirit of the
devil, be sunk in the most pernicious errors, both doctrinal and
moral.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Figures of the Church</h3>

<p>The figures of the Old Testament have great power to stimulate
the minds of the faithful and to remind them of these most
beautiful truths. It was for this reason chiefly that the
Apostles made use of these figures. The pastor, therefore, should
not overlook so fruitful a source of instruction.</p>

<p> Among these figures the ark of Noah holds a conspicuous
place. It was built by the command of God, in order that there
might be no doubt that it was a symbol of the Church, which God
has so constituted that all who enter therein through Baptism,
may be safe from danger of eternal death, while such as are
outside the Church, like those who were not in the ark, are
overwhelmed by their own crimes.</p>

<p> Another figure presents itself in the great city of
Jerusalem, which, in Scripture, often means the Church. In
Jerusalem only was it lawful to offer sacrifice to God, and in
the Church of God only are to be found the true worship and true
sacrifice which can at all be acceptable to God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;I Believe the Holy Catholic Church&quot; </h3>

<p>Finally, with regard to the Church, the pastor should teach
how to believe the Church can constitute an Article of faith.
Although reason and the senses are able to ascertain the
existence of the Church, that is, of a society of men on earth
devoted and consecrated to Jesus Christ, and although faith does
not seem necessary in order to understand a truth which even Jews
and Turks do not doubt; nevertheless it is from the light of
faith only, not from the deductions of reason, that the mind can
grasp those mysteries contained in the Church of God which have
been partly made known above and will again be treated under the
Sacrament of Holy Orders. </p>

<p> Since, therefore, this Article, no less than the others, is
placed above the reach, and defies the strength of the human
understanding, most justly do we confess that we know not from
human reason, but contemplate with the eyes of faith the origin,
offices and dignity of the Church.</p>

<p> This Church was founded not by man, but by the immortal God
Himself, who built her upon a most solid rock. The Highest
himself, says the Prophet, hath founded her. Hence, she is called
the inheritance of God, the people of God. The power which she
possesses is not from man but from God.</p>

<p> Since this power, therefore, cannot be of human origin,
divine faith can alone enable us to understand that the keys of
the. kingdom of heaven are deposited with the Church, that to her
has been confided the power of remitting sins,&quot; of
denouncing excommunication, and of consecrating the real body of
Christ; and t}tat her children have not here a permanent
dwelling, but look for one above.</p>

<p> We are, therefore, bound to believe that there is one Holy
Catholic Church. With regard to the Three Persons of the Holy
Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we not</p>

<p> only believe them, but also believe in them. But here we make
use of a different form of expression, professing to believe the
holy, not in the holy Catholic Church. By this difference of
expression we distinguish God, the author of all things, from His
works, and acknowledge that all the exalted benefits bestowed on
the Church are due to God's bounty.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Part of this Article: &quot;The Communion of
Saints&quot; </h3>

<p>The Evangelist St. John, writing to the faithful on the divine
mysteries, explains as follows why he undertook to instruct them
in these truths: That you may have fellowship with us, and our
fellowship may be with the Father, and with his son Jesus Christ.
This fellowship consists in the Communion of Saints, the subject
of the present Article.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Importance Of This Truth</h6>

<p> Would that in its exposition pastors imitated the zeal of
Paul and of the other Apostles. For not only is it a development
of the preceding Article and a doctrine productive of abundant
fruit; it also teaches the use to be made of the mysteries
contained in the Creed, because the great end to which we should
direct all our study and knowledge of them is that we may be
admitted into this most august and blessed society of the Saints,
and may steadily persevere therein, giving thanks with joy to God
the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of
the saints in light.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Meaning of &quot;The Communion of Saints&quot; </h3>

<p>The faithful, therefore, in the first place are to be informed
that this part of the Article, is, as it were, a sort of
explanation of the preceding part which regards the unity,
sanctity and catholicity of the Church. For the unity of the
Spirit, by which she is governed, brings it about that whatsoever
has been given to the Church is held as a common possession by
all her members.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Communion Of Sacraments</h3>

<p>The fruit of all the Sacraments is common to all the faithful,
and these Sacraments, particularly Baptism, the door, as it were,
by which we are admitted into the Church, are so many sacred
bonds which bind and unite them to Christ. That this communion of
Saints implies a communion of Sacraments, the Fathers declare in
these words of the Creed: I confess one Baptism. After Baptism,
the Eucharist holds the first place in reference to this
communion, and after that the other Sacraments; for although this
name (communion) is applicable to all the Sacraments, inasmuch as
they unite us to God, and render us partakers of Him whose grace
we receive, yet it belongs in a peculiar manner to the Eucharist
which actually produces this communion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Communion Of Good Works</h3>

<p>But there is also another communion in the Church which
demands attention. Every pious and holy action done by one
belongs to and becomes profitable to all through charity, which
seeketh not her Own. This is proved by the testimony of St.
Ambrose, who, explaining these words of the Psalmist, I am a
partaker with all them that f ear thee, observes: As we say that
a limb is partaker of the entire body, so are we partakers with
all that fear God. Therefore has Christ taught us that form of
prayer in which we say our, not my bread; and the other Petitions
are equally general, not confined to ourselves alone, but
directed also to the common interest and the salvation of all.</p>

<p> This communication of goods is often very aptly illustrated
in Scripture by a comparison borrowed from the members of the
human body. In the human body there are many members, but though
many, they yet constitute but one body, in which each performs
its own, not all the same, functions. All do not enjoy equal
dignity, or discharge functions alike useful or honourable; nor
does one propose to itself its own exclusive advantage, but that
Of the entire body. Besides, they are so well organised</p>

<p> and knit together that if one suffers, the rest likewise
suffer on account of their affinity and sympathy of nature; and
if, on the contrary, one enjoys health, the feeling of pleasure
is common to all.</p>

<p> The same may be observed in the Church. She is composed of
various members; that is, of different nations, of Jews,
Gentiles, freemen and slaves, of rich and poor; when they have
been baptised, they constitute one body with Christ, of which He
is the Head. To each member of the Church is also assigned his
own peculiar office. As some are appointed apostles, some
teachers, but all for the common good; so to some it belongs to
govern and teach, to others to be subject and to obey.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those Who Share In This Communion</h3>

<p>The advantages of so many and such exalted blessings bestowed
by Almighty God are enjoyed by those who lead a Christian life in
charity, and are just and beloved of God. As to the dead members;
that is, those who are bound in the thraldom of sin and estranged
from the grace of God, they are not so deprived of these
advantages as to cease to be members of this body; but since they
are dead members, they do not share in the spiritual fruit which
is communicated to the just and pious. However, as they are in
the Church, they are assisted in recovering lost grace and life
by those who live by the Spirit; and they also enjoy those
benefits which are without doubt denied to those who are entirely
cut off from the Church. </p>

<h3>Communion In Other Blessings</h3>

<p>Not only the gifts which justify and endear us to God are
common. Graces gratuitously granted, such as knowledge, prophecy,
the gifts of tongues and of miracles, and others of the same
sort, are common also, and are granted even to the wicked, not,
however, for their own but for the general good, for the
edification of the Church. Thus, the gift of healing is given not
for the sake of him who heals, but for the sake of him who is
healed.</p>

<p> In fine, every true Christian possesses nothing which he
should not consider common to all others with himself, and should
therefore be prepared promptly to relieve an indigent
fellow­creature. For he that is blessed with worldly goods, and
sees his brother in want, and will not assist him, is plainly
convicted of not having the love of God within him.</p>

<p> Those, therefore, who belong to this holy communion, it is
manifest, do now enjoy a certain degree of happiness and can
truly say: How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! my
soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord.... Blessed
are they who dwell in thy house, Lord.</p>
