<h3></center>ARTICLE XII : &quot;LIFE EVERLASTING&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>The holy Apostles, our guides, thought fit to conclude the
Creed, which is the summary of our faith, with the Article on
eternal life: first, because after the resurrection of the body
the only object of the Christian's hope is the reward of
everlasting life; and secondly, in order that perfect happiness,
embracing as it does the fullness of all good, may be ever
present to our minds and absorb all our thoughts and affections.</p>

<p> In his instructions to the faithful the pastor, therefore,
should unceasingly endeavour to light up in their souls an ardent
desire of the promised rewards of eternal life, so that whatever
difficult duties he may inculcate as a part of the Christian's
life, the faithful may look upon as light, or even agreeable, and
may yield a more willing and cheerful obedience to God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Life Everlasting&quot;</h3>

<p>As many mysteries lie concealed under the words which are here
used to declare the happiness reserved for us, they are to be
explained in such a manner as to make them intelligible to all,
as far as each one's capacity will allow.</p>

<p> The faithful, therefore, are to be informed that the words,
life everlasting, signify not only continuance of existence,
which even the demons and the wicked possess, but also that
perpetuity of happiness which is to satisfy the desires of the
blessed. In this sense they were understood by the lawyer
mentioned in the Gospel when he asked the Lord our Saviour: What
shall I do to possess everlasting life? as if he had said, What
shall I do in order to arrive at the enjoyment of perfect
happiness? In this sense these words are understood in the Sacred
Scriptures, as is clear from many passages.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Everlasting&quot;</h3>

<p>The supreme happiness of the blessed is called by this name
(life everlasting) principally to exclude the notion that it
consists in corporeal and transitory things, which cannot be
everlasting. The word blessedness is insufficient to express the
idea, particularly as there have not been wanting men who, puffed
up by the teachings of a vain philosophy, would place the supreme
good in sensible things. But these grow old and perish, while
supreme happiness is to be terminated by no lapse of time. Nay
more, so far is the enjoyment of the goods of this life from
conferring real happiness that, on the contrary, he who is
captivated by a love of the world is farthest removed from true
happiness; for it is written: Love not the world, nor the things
which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of
the Father is not in him, and a little farther on we read: The
world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof.</p>

<p> The pastor, therefore, should be careful to impress these
truths on the minds of the faithful, that they may learn to
despise earthly things, and to know that in this world, in which
we are not citizens but sojourners, happiness is not to be found.
Yet even here below we may be said with truth to be happy in
hope, if denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we . . . live
soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, looking for the
blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ. Very many who seemed to themselves wise,
not understanding these things, and imagining that happiness was
to be sought in this life, became fools and the victims of the
most deplorable calamities.</p>

<p> These words, life everlasting, also teach us that, contrary
to the false notions of some, happiness once attained can never
be lost. Happiness is an accumulation of all good without
admixture of evil, which, as it fills up the measure of man's
desires, must be eternal. He who is blessed with happiness must
earnestly desire the continued enjoyment of those goods which he
has obtained. Hence, unless its possession be permanent and
certain, he is necessarily a prey to the most tormenting
apprehension. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Life</h3>

<p>The intensity of the happiness which the just enjoy in their
celestial country, and its utter incomprehensibility to all but
themselves alone, are sufficiently conveyed by the very words
blessed life. For when in order to express any idea we make use
of a word common to many things, it is clear that we do so
because we have no exact term by which to express it fully.
Since, therefore, to express happiness, words are adopted which
are not more applicable to the blessed than to all who are to
live for ever, this proves to us that the idea presents to the
mind something too great, too exalted, to be expressed fully by a
proper term. True, the happiness of heaven is expressed in
Scripture by a variety of other words, such as the kingdom of
God, of Christ, of heaven, paradise, the holy city, the new
Jerusalem, my Father's house; yet it is clear that none of these
appellations is sufficient to convey an adequate idea of its
greatness.</p>

<p> The pastor, therefore, should not neglect the opportunity
which this Article affords of inviting the faithful to the
practice of piety, of justice and of all the other Christian
duties, by holding out to them such ample rewards as are
announced in the words life everlasting. Among the blessings
which we instinctively desire life is certainly esteemed one of
the greatest. Now it is chiefly by this blessing that we describe
the happiness (of the just) when we say life everlasting. If,
then, there is nothing more loved, nothing dearer or sweeter,
than this short and calamitous life, which is subject to so many
and such various miseries that it should rather be called death;
with what ardour of soul, with what earnestness of purpose,
should we not seek that eternal life which, without evil of any
sort, presents to us the pure and unmixed enjoyment of every
good?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Negative and Positive Elements of Eternal Life </h3>

<p>The happiness of eternal life is, as defined by the Fathers,
an exemption from all evil, and an enjoyment of all good. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Negative</h3>

<p>Concerning (the exemption from all) evil the Scriptures bear
witness in the most explicit terms. For it is written in the
Apocalypse: They shall no more hunger nor thirst, neither shall
the sun fall on them, nor any heat; '° and again, God shall wipe
away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor
mourning nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the former
things are passed away.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Positive</h3>

<p>As for the glory of the blessed, it shall be without measure,
and the kinds of their solid joys and pleasures without number.
Since our minds cannot grasp the greatness of this glory, nor can
it possibly enter into our souls, it is necessary for us to enter
into it, that is, into the joy of the Lord, so that immersed
therein we may completely satisfy the longing of our hearts.</p>

<p> Although, as St. Augustine observes, it would seem easier to
enumerate the evils from which we shall be exempt than the goods
and the pleasures which we shall enjoy; yet we must endeavour to
explain, briefly and clearly, these things which are calculated
to inflame the faithful with a desire of arriving at the
enjoyment of this supreme felicity.</p>

<p> But first of all we should make use of a distinction which
has been sanctioned by the most eminent writers on religion; for
they teach that there are two sorts of goods, one of which
constitutes happiness, the other follows upon it. The former,
therefore, for the sake of perspicuity, they have called
essential blessings, the latter, accessory.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Essential Happiness</h3>

<p>Solid happiness, which we may designate by the common
appellation, essential, consists in the vision of God, and the
enjoyment of His beauty who is the source and principle of all
goodness and perfection. This, says Christ our Lord, is eternal
life: that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent. These words St. John seems to
interpret when he says: Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of
God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that
when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shawl
see him as he is. He shows, then, that beatitude consists of two
things: that we shall behold God such as He is in His own nature
and substance; and that we ourselves shall become, as it were,
gods.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Light Of Glory</h3>

<p>For those who enjoy God while they retain their own nature,
assume a certain admirable and almost divine form, so as to seem
gods rather than men. Why this transformation takes place becomes
at once intelligible if we only reflect that a thing is known
either from its essence, or from its image and appearance,
consequently, as nothing so resembles God as to afford by its
resemblance a perfect knowledge of Him, it follows that no
creature can behold His Divine Nature and Essence unless this
same Divine Essence has joined itself to us, and this St. Paul
means when he says: We now see through a glass in a dark manner;
but then face to face.' The words, in a dark manner, St.
Augustine understands to mean that we see Him in a resemblance
calculated to convey to us some notion of the Deity.</p>

<p> This St. Denis' also clearly shows when he says that the
things above cannot be known by comparison with the things below;
for the essence and substance of anything incorporeal cannot be
known through the image of that which is corporeal, particularly
as a resemblance must be less gross and more spiritual than that
which it represents, as we easily know from universal experience.
Since, therefore, it is impossible that any image drawn from
created things should be equally pure and spiritual with God, no
resemblance can enable us perfectly to comprehend the Divine
Essence. Moreover, all created things are circumscribed within
certain limits of perfection, while God is without limits; and
therefore nothing created can reflect His immensity.</p>

<p> The only means, then, of arriving at a knowledge of the
Divine Essence is that God unite Himself in some sort to us, and
after an incomprehensible manner elevate our minds to a higher
degree of perfection, and thus render us capable of contemplating
the beauty of His Nature. This the light of His glory will
accomplish. Illumined by its splendour we shall see God, the true
light, in His own light.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Beatific Vision</h3>

<p>  For the blessed always see God present and by this
greatest and most exalted of gifts, being made partakers of the
divine nature, they enjoy true and solid happiness. Our belief in
this happiness should be joined with an assured hope that we too
shall one day, through the divine goodness, attain it. This the
Fathers declared in their Creed, which says: I expect the
resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>An Illustration Of This Truth</h3>

<p>These are truths, so divine that they cannot be expressed in
any words or comprehended by us in thought. We may, however,
trace some resemblance of this happiness in sensible objects.
Thus, iron when acted on by fire becomes inflamed and while it is
substantially the same seems changed into fire, a different
substance; so likewise the blessed, who are admitted into the
glory of heaven and burn with a love of God, are so affected
that, without ceasing to be what they are, they may be said with
truth to differ more from those still on earth than red­hot iron
differs from itself when cold.</p>

<p> To say all in a few words, supreme and absolute happiness,
which we call essential, consists in the possession of God; for
what can he lack to consummate his happiness who possesses the
God of all goodness and perfection?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Accessory Happiness</h3>

<p>To this happiness, however, are added certain gifts which are
common to all the blessed, and which, because more within the
reach of human comprehension, are generally found more effectual
in moving and inflaming the heart. These the Apostle seems to
have in view when, in his Epistle to the Romans, he says: Glory
and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Glory</h3>

<p>For the blessed shall enjoy glory; not only that glory which
we have already shown to constitute essential happiness, or to be
its inseparable accompaniment, but also that glory which consists
in the clear and distinct knowledge which each (of the blessed)
shall have of the singular and exalted dignity of his companions
(in glory).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Honour</h3>

<p>And how distinguished must not that honour be which is
conferred by God Himself, who no longer calls them servants, but
friends, brethren and sons of God! Hence the Redeemer will
address His elect in these most loving and honourable words:
Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared
for you. Justly, then, may we exclaim: Thy friends, O God, are
made exceedingly honourable. They shall also receive the highest
praise from Christ the Lord, in presence of His heavenly Father
and His Angels.</p>

<p> And if nature has implanted in the heart of every man the
common desire of securing the esteem of men eminent for wisdom,
because they are deemed the most reliable judges of merit, what
an accession of glory to the blessed, to show towards each other
the highest veneration !</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Peace</h3>

<p>To enumerate all the delights with which the souls of the
blessed shall be filled would be an endless task. We cannot even
conceive them in thought. With this truth, however, the minds of
the faithful should be deeply impressed ­­ that the happiness
of the Saints is full to overflowing of all those pleasures which
can be enjoyed or even desired in this life, whether they regard
the powers of the mind or of the perfection of the body; albeit
this must be in a manner more exalted than, to use the Apostle's
words, eye hath seen, ear heard, or the heart of man conceived. </p>

<p> Thus the body, which was before gross and material, shall put
off in heaven its mortality, and having become refined and
spiritualised, will no longer require corporal food; while the
soul shall be satiated to its supreme delight with that eternal
food of glory which the Master of that great feast passing will
minister to all.</p>

<p> Who will desire rich apparel or royal robes, where there
shall be no further use for such things, and where all shall be
clothed with immortality and splendour, and adorned with a crown
of imperishable glory?</p>

<p> And if the possession of a spacious and magnificent mansion
contributes to human happiness, what more spacious, what more
magnificent, can be conceived than heaven itself, which is
illumined throughout with the brightness of God ? Hence the
Prophet, contemplating the beauty of this dwelling­place, and
burning with the desire of reaching those mansions of bliss,
exclaims: How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! my
soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart
and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. That the faithful
may be all filled with the same sentiments and utter the same
language should be the object of the pastor's most earnest
desires, as it should also be of his zealous labours. For in my
Father's house, says our Lord, there are many mansions,&quot; in
which shall be distributed rewards of greater and of less value
according to each one's deserts. He who soweth sparingly, shall
also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also
reap blessings.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How to Arrive at the Enjoyment of this Happiness </h3>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should not only encourage the faithful
to seek this happiness, but should frequently remind them that
the sure way of obtaining it is to possess the virtues of faith
and charity, to persevere in prayer and the use of the
Sacraments, and to discharge all the duties of kindness towards
their neighbour. </p>

<p> Thus, through the mercy of God, who has prepared that blessed
glory for those who love Him, shall be one day fulfilled the
words of the Prophet: My people shall sit in the beauty of peace,
and in the tabernacle of confidence, and in wealthy rest.  </p>
