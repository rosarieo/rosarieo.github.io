<h2><center>PART IV : THE LORD'S PRAYER</center></h2>

<h3>PRAYER</h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On Prayer</h3>

<p>One of the duties of the pastoral office, which is of the
highest importance to the spiritual interests of the faithful, is
to instruct them on Christian prayer; the nature and efficacy of
which must remain unknown to many, if not taught by the pious and
faithful diligence of the pastor. To this, therefore, should the
care of the pastor be directed in a special manner, that his
devout hearers may understand how and for what they are to ask
God.</p>

<p> Whatever is necessary to the performance of the duty of
prayer is comprised in that divine formula which Christ the Lord
deigned to make known to His Apostles, and through them and their
successors to all Christians. Its thoughts and words should be so
deeply impressed on the mind and memory as to be ever in
readiness. To assist pastors, however, in teaching the faithful
concerning this prayer, we have set down from those writers who
are conspicuous for learning and fullness in this matter,
whatever appeared to us most suitable, leaving it to pastors to
draw upon the same sources for further information, should they
deem it necessary. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity of Prayer</h3>

<p>In the first place the necessity of prayer should be insisted
upon. Prayer is a duty not only recommended by way of counsel,
but also commanded by obligatory precept. Christ the Lord
declared this when He said: We should pray always. This necessity
of prayer the Church points out in the prelude, if we may so call
it, which she prefixes to the Lord's Prayer: Admonished by
salutary precepts, and taught by divine instruction, we presume
to say, etc.</p>

<p> Therefore, since prayer is necessary to the Christian, the
Son of God, yielding to the request of the disciples, Lord, teach
us to pray, gave them a prescribed form of prayer, and encouraged
them to hope that the objects of their petitions would be
granted. He Himself was to them a model of prayer; He not only
prayed assiduously, but watched whole nights in prayer.</p>

<p> The Apostles, also, did not omit to recommend this duty to
those who had been converted to the faith of Jesus Christ. St.
Peter and St. John are most diligent in their admonitions to the
devout; and the Apostle, mindful of its nature, frequently
admonishes Christians of the salutary necessity of prayer.</p>

<p> Besides, so various are our temporal and spiritual
necessities, that we must have recourse to prayer as the best
means for communicating our wants and receiving whatever we need.
For since God owes nothing to anyone, we must ask of Him in
prayer those things we need, seeing that He has constituted
prayer as a necessary means for the accomplishment of our
desires, particularly since it is clear that there are blessings
which we cannot hope to obtain otherwise than through prayer.
Thus devout prayer has such efficacy that it is a most powerful
means of casting out demons; for there is a certain kind of demon
which is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.</p>

<p> Those, therefore, who do not practice assiduous and regular
prayer deprive themselves of a powerful means of obtaining gifts
of singular value. To succeed in obtaining the object of your
desires, it is not enough that you ask that which is good; your
entreaties must also be assiduous. Every one that asketh, says
St. Jerome, receiveth, as it is written. If, therefore, it is not
given you, this is because you do not ask. Ask, therefore, and
you shall receive.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Fruits of Prayer</h3>

<p>Moreover, this necessity of prayer is also productive of the
greatest delight and usefulness, since it bears most abundant
fruits. When it is necessary to instruct the faithful concerning
these fruits, pastors will find ample matter in sacred writers.
We have made from these sources a selection which appeared to us
to suit the present purpose.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Honours God</h3>

<p>The first fruit which we receive is that by praying we honour
God, since prayer is a certain act of religion, which is compared
in Scripture to a sweet perfume. Let my prayer, says the Prophet,
be directed as incense in thy sight. By prayer we confess our
subjection to God; we acknowledge and proclaim Him to be the
author of all good, in whom alone we center all our hopes, who
alone is our refuge, in all dangers and the bulwark of our
salvation. Of this fruit we are admonished also in these words:
Call upon me in the day of trouble; I ­will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Obtains What We Request</h3>

<p>Another most pleasing and invaluable fruit of prayer is that
it is heard by God. Prayer is the key of heaven, says St.
Augustine; prayer ascends, and the mercy of God descends. High as
are the heavens, and low as is the earth, God hears the voice of
man. Such is the utility, such the efficacy of prayer, that
through it we obtain a plenitude of heavenly gifts. Thus by
prayer we secure the guidance and aid of the Holy Spirit, the
security and preservation of the faith, deliverance from
punishment, divine protection under temptation, victory over the
devil. In a word, there is in prayer an accumulation of spiritual
joy; and hence our Lord said: Ask, and you shall receive, that
your joy may be full.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Proof</h3>

<p>Nor can we, for a moment, doubt that God in His goodness
awaits and is at all times ready to hear our petitions ­­ a
truth to which the Sacred Scriptures bear ample testimony. Since,
however, the texts are easy of access, we shall content ourselves
with citing as an example the words of Isaias: Then shalt thou
call, and the Lord will hear: thou shalt cry, and he will say,
&quot;Here I am&quot;; and again, It shall come to pass, that
before they call, I will hear: as they are yet speaking, I will
hear. With regard to instances of persons, who have obtained from
God the objects of their prayers, they are almost innumerable,
and too well known to require special mention.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Unwise And Indevout Prayers Unheard</h3>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, it happens that what we ask of God we do
not obtain. But it is then especially that God looks to our
welfare, either because He bestows on us other gifts of higher
value and in greater abundance, or because what we ask, far from
being necessary or useful, would prove superfluous and injurious.
God, says St. Augustine, denies some things in His mercy which He
grants in His wrath.</p>

<p> Sometimes, also, such is the remissness and negligence with
which we pray, that we ourselves do not attend to what we say.
Since prayer is an elevation of the soul to God, if, while we
pray, the mind, instead of being fixed upon God, is distracted,
and the tongue slurs over the words at random, without attention,
without devotion, with what propriety can we give to such empty
sounds the name of Christian prayer?</p>

<p> We should not, therefore, be at all surprised, if God does
not comply with our requests; either because by our negligence
and indifference we almost show that we do not really desire what
we ask, or because we ask those things, which, if granted, would
be prejudicial to our interests.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>To Devout Prayer And Dispositions God Grants More
Than Is Asked</h3>

<p>On the other hand, to those who pray with devout attention,
God grants more than they ask. This the Apostle declares in his
Epistle to the Ephesians, and the same truth is unfolded ill the
parable of the prodigal son, who would have deemed it a kindness
to be admitted into the number of his father's servants. </p>

<p> Nay, God heaps His favours not only on those who seek them,
but also on those who are rightly disposed; and this, not only
with abundance, but also with readiness. This is shown by the
words of Scripture: The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor.
For God hastens to grant the inner and hidden desires of the
needy without awaiting their utterance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Exercises And Increases Faith</h3>

<p>Another fruit of prayer is, that it exercises and augments the
virtues of the soul, particularly the virtue of faith. As they
who have not faith in God, cannot pray as they ought, for how can
they call on him, whom they have not believed ? so the faithful,
in proportion to the fervour of their prayers, possess a stronger
and a more assured faith in the protecting providence of God,
which requires principally that in all needs we have recourse to
Him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Strengthens Our Hope In God</h3>

<p>God, it is true, might bestow on us all things abundantly,
although we did not ask them or even think of them, just as He
bestows on the irrational creation all things necessary for the
support of life. But our most bountiful Father wishes to be
invoked by His children; He wishes that, praying as we ought each
day of our lives, we may pray with increased confidence. He
wishes that in obtaining our requests we may more and more bear
witness to and declare His goodness towards us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Increases Charity</h3>

<p>Our charity is also augmented. In recognising God as the
author of every blessing and of every good, we are led to cling
to Him with the most devoted love. And as those who cherish a
mutual affection become more ardently attached by frequent
interviews and conversations, so the oftener the soul prays
devoutly and implores the divine mercy, thus holding converse
with God, the more exquisite is the sense of delight which she
experiences in each prayer, and the more ardently is she inflamed
to love and adore Him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Disposes The Soul For Divine Blessings </h3>

<p>Furthermore, God wishes us to make use of prayer, in order
that burning with the desire of asking what we are anxious to
obtain, we may thus by our perseverance and zeal make such
advances in spiritual life, as to be worthy to obtain those
blessings which the soul could not obtain before because of its
dryness and lack of devotion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Makes Us Realise Our Own Needfulness</h3>

<p>Moreover, God wishes us to realise, and always keep in mind,
that, unassisted by His heavenly grace, we can of ourselves do
nothing, and should therefore apply ourselves to prayer with all
the powers of our souls.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Is A Protection Against The Devil</h3>

<p>The weapons which prayer supplies are most powerful against
our bitterest foes. With the cries of our prayers, says St.
Hilary, we must fight against the devil and his armed hosts. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Promotes A Virtuous Life</h3>

<p>From prayer we also derive this important advantage that
though we are inclined to evil and to the indulgence of various
passions, as a consequence of our natural frailty, God permits us
to raise our hearts to Him, in order that while we address Him in
prayer, and endeavour to deserve His gifts, we may be inspired
with a love of innocence, and, by effacing our sins, be purified
from every stain of guilt.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prayer Disarms The Divine Vengeance</h3>

<p>Finally, as St. Jerome observes, prayer disarms the anger of
God. Hence, these words of God addressed to Moses: Let me alone,
when Moses sought by his prayer to stay the punishments God was
about to inflict on His people. Nothing is so efficacious in
appeasing God, when His wrath is kindled; nothing so effectually
delays or averts the punishments prepared for the wicked as the
prayers of men.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Parts Of Prayer</h3>

<p>The necessity and advantages of Christian prayer being
explained, the faithful should also know how many, and what are
the parts of which it is composed; for that this pertains to the
perfect discharge of this duty, we learn from the Apostle. In his
Epistle to Timothy, exhorting to pious and holy prayer, he
carefully enumerates the parts of which it consists: I desire
therefore first of all that supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men. Although
the shades of distinction between these different parts of prayer
are delicate, yet the pastor, should he deem the explanation
useful to his people, should consult, among others, St. Hilary
and St. Augustine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Two Chief Parts Of Prayer Petition And
Thanksgiving </h3>

<p>There are two principal parts of prayer, petition and
thanksgiving, and since these are the sources, as it were, from
which all the others spring, they appear to us to be of too much
importance to be omitted. For we approach God and offer Him the
tribute of our worship, either to obtain some favour, or to
return Him thanks for those with which His bounty every day
enriches and adorns us. God Himself indicated both these most
necessary parts of prayer when He declared by the mouth of David:
Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.</p>

<p> Who does not perceive how much we stand in need of the
goodness and beneficence of God, if he but consider the extreme
destitution and misery of man?</p>

<p> On the other hand, all that have eyes and understanding know
God's loving kindness toward man and the liberal bounty He
exercises in our behalf. Wherever we cast our eyes, wherever we
turn our thoughts, the admirable light of the divine goodness and
beneficence beams upon us. What have we that is not the gift of
His bounty? If, then, all things are the gifts and favours
bestowed on us by His goodness, why should not everyone, as much
as possible, celebrate the praises of God, and thank Him for His
boundless beneficence.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Degrees Of Petition And Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Of these duties of petition and thanksgiving each contains
many subordinate degrees. In order, therefore, that the faithful
may not only pray, but also pray in the best manner, the pastor
should propose to them the most perfect mode of praying, and
should exhort them to use it to the best of their ability. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Highest Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of The Just</h3>

<p>What, then, is the best manner and the most exalted degree of
prayer? It is that which is made use of by the pious and the
just. Resting on the solid foundation of the true faith, they
rise successively from one degree of prayer and virtue to
another, until, at length, they reach that height of perfection,
whence they can contemplate the infinite power, goodness, and
wisdom of God; where, too, they are animated with the assured
hope of obtaining not only those blessings which they desire in
this life, but also those unutterable rewards which God has
pledged Himself to grant to him who piously and religiously
implores His assistance.</p>

<p> Soaring, as it were, to heaven, on these two wings, the soul
approaches, in fervent desire, the Divinity; adores with supreme
praise and thanksgiving Him from whom she has received such
inestimable blessings; and, like an only child, animated with
singular piety and profound veneration, trustfully tells her most
beloved Father all her wants. </p>

<p> This sort of prayer the Sacred Scriptures express by the
words pouring out. In his sight, says the Prophet, I pour out my
proyer, but before him I declare my trouble. This means that he
who comes to pray should conceal or omit nothing, but pour out
all, flying with confidence into the bosom of God, his most
loving Father. To this the Sacred Scriptures exhort us in these
words: Pour out thy heart before him, cast thy care upon the
Lord. This is that degree of prayer to which St. Augustine
alludes when he says in that book entitled Enchiridion: What
faith believes, that hope and charity implore.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Second Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of Sinners </h3>

<p>Another degree of prayer is that of those who are weighed down
by the guilt of mortal sin, but who strive, with what is called
dead faith, to raise themselves from their condition and to
ascend to God. But, in consequence of their languid state and the
extreme weakness of their faith, they cannot raise themselves
from the earth. Recognising their crimes and stung with remorse
of conscience, they bow themselves down with humility, and, far
as they are removed from God, implore of Him with penitential
sorrow, the pardon of their sins and the peace of reconciliation.
</p>

<p> The prayers of such persons are not rejected by God, but are
heard by Him. Nay, in His mercy, He generously invites such as
these to have recourse to Him, saying: Come to me, all you that
labour, and are heavily laden, and I will refresh you, of this
class was the publican, who, though he did not dare to raise his
eyes towards heaven, left the Temple, as (our Lord) declares,
more justified than the Pharisee.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Third Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of Unbelievers
</h3>

<p>A third degree of prayer is that which is offered by those who
have not as yet been illumined with the light of faith; but who,
when the divine goodness illumines in their souls the feeble
natural light, are strongly moved to the desire and pursuit of
truth and most earnestly pray for a knowledge of it. </p>

<p> If they persevere in such dispositions, God, in His mercy,
will not neglect their earnest endeavours, as we see verified by
the example of Cornelius the centurion. The doors of the divine
mercy are closed against none who sincerely ask for mercy.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Lowest Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of The
Impenitent </h3>

<p>The last degree is that of those who not only do not repent of
their sins and enormities, but, adding crime to crime, dare
frequently to ask pardon of God for those sins, in which they are
resolved to continue. With such dispositions they would not
presume to ask pardon from their fellow­man.</p>

<p> The prayer of such sinners is not heard by God. It is
recorded of Antiochus: Then this wicked man prayed to the Lord,
of whom he was not to obtain mercy. Whoever lives in this
deplorable condition should be vehemently exhorted to wean
himself from all affection to sin, and to return to God in good
earnest and from the heart. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What We Should Pray For</h3>

<p>Under the head of each Petition we shall point out in its
proper place, what is, and what is not a proper object of prayer.
Hence it will suffice here to remind the faithful in a general
way that they ought to ask of God such things as are just and
good, lest, praying for what is not suitable, they may be
repelled in these words: You know not what you ask. Whatever it
is lawful to desire, it is lawful to pray for, as is proved by
the Lord's ample promise: You shall ask whatever you will, and it
shall be done unto you, words in which He promises to grant all
things.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Spiritual Goods</h3>

<p>In the first place, then, the standard which should regulate
all our wishes is that we desire above all else God, the supreme
Good. After God we should most desire those things which unite us
most closely to Him; while those which would separate us from
Him, or occasion that separation, should have no share whatever
in our affections.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>External Goods And Goods Of Body</h3>

<p>Taking, then, as our standard the supreme and perfect Good, we
can easily infer how we are to desire and ask from God our Father
those other things which are called goods. Goods which are called
bodily, such as health, strength, beauty and those which are
external, such as riches, honours, glory, often supply the means
and give occasion for sin; and, therefore, it is not always
either pious or salutary to ask for them. We should pray for
these goods of life only in so far as we need them, thus
referring all to God. It cannot be deemed unlawful to pray for
those things for which Jacob and Solomon prayed. If, says Jacob,
he shall give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, the Lord
shall be my God. Give me, says Solomon, only the necessaries of
life.</p>

<p> But when we are supplied by the bounty of God with
necessaries and comforts, we should not forget the admonition of
the Apostle: Let them that buy, be as if they possessed not, and
those that use this world, as if they used it not; for the figure
of this world passeth away; and again, If riches abound, set not
your heart upon them. God Himself teaches us that only the use
and fruit of these things belong to us and that we are obliged to
share them with others. If we are blessed with health, if we
abound in other external and corporal goods, we should recollect
that they are given to us in order to enable us to serve God with
greater fidelity, and as the means of lending assistance to
others. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Goods Of The Mind</h3>

<p>It is also lawful to pray for the goods and adornments of the
mind, such as a knowledge of the arts and sciences, provided our
prayers are accompanied with this condition, that they serve to
promote the glory of God and our own salvation.</p>

<p> The only thing which can be absolutely and unconditionally
the object of our wishes, our desires and our prayers, is, as we
have already observed, the glory of God, and, next to it,
whatever can serve to unite us to that supreme Good, such as
faith and the fear and love of God, of which we shall treat at
length when we come to explain the Petitions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>For Whom We Ought to Pray</h3>

<p>The objects of prayer being known, the faithful are next to be
taught for whom they are to pray. Prayer comprehends petition and
thanksgiving. We shall first treat of petition.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Prayer Of Petition Should Be Offered For All</h3>

<p>We are to pray for all mankind, without exception of enemies,
nation or religion; for every man, be he enemy, stranger or
infidel, is our neighbour, whom God commands us to love, and for
whom, therefore, we should discharge a duty of love, which is
prayer. To the discharge of this duty the Apostle exhort: when he
says: I desire that prayer be made for all men. In such prayers
we should first ask for those things that concern spiritual
interests, and next for what pertains to temporal welfare.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those For Whom We Should Especially Offer Our
Petitions: Pastors </h3>

<p>Before all others the pastors of our souls have a right to our
prayers, as we learn from the example of the Apostle in his
Epistle to the Colossians, in which he asks them to pray for him,
that God may open unto him a door of speech, a request which he
also makes in his Epistle to the Thessalonians. In the Acts of
the Apostles we also read that prayers were offered in the Church
without intermission for Peter. St. Basil, in his work On Morals,
urges to a faithful compliance with this obligation. We must, he
says, pray for those who are charged with preaching the word of
truth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Rulers Of Our Country</h3>

<p>In the next place, as the same Apostle teaches, we should pray
for our rulers.</p>

<p> Who does not know what a singular blessing a people enjoy in
public officials who are just and upright? We should, therefore,
beseech God to make them such as they ought to be, fit persons to
govern others.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Just</h3>

<p>To offer up our prayers also for the good and pious is a
practice taught by the example of holy men. Even the good and the
pious need the prayers of others. Providence has wisely ordained
it so, in order that the just, realising the necessity they are
under of being aided by the prayers of those who are inferior to
them, may not be inflated with pride.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Enemies And Those Outside The Church</h3>

<p>The Lord has also commanded us, to pray for those that
persecute and calumniate us. The practice of praying for those
who are not within the pale of the Church, is, as we know on the
authority of St. Augustine, of Apostolic origin. We pray that the
faith may be made known to infidels; that idolaters may be
rescued from the error of their impiety; that the Jews, emerging
from the darkness with which they are encompassed, may arrive at
the light of truth; that heretics, returning to soundness of
mind, may be instructed in the Catholic faith; and that
schismatics may be united in the bond of true charity and may
return to the communion of their holy mother, the Church, from
which they have separated.</p>

<p> Many examples prove that prayers for such as these are very
efficacious when offered from the heart. Instances occur every
day in which God rescues individuals of every condition of life
from the powers of darkness, and transfers them into the kingdom
of His Beloved Son, from vessels of wrath making them vessels of
mercy. That the prayers of the pious have very great influence in
bringing about this result no one can reasonably doubt.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Dead</h3>

<p>Prayers for the dead, that they may be liberated from the fire
of purgatory, are derived from Apostolic teaching. But on this
subject we have said enough when explaining the Holy Sacrifice of
the Mass.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sinners</h3>

<p>Those who are said to sin unto death derive little advantage
from prayers and supplications. It is, however, the part of
Christian charity to offer up our prayers and tears for them, in
order, if possible, to obtain their reconciliation with God.</p>

<p> With regard to the execrations uttered by holy men against
the wicked, it is certain, from the teaching of the Fathers, that
they are either prophecies of the evils which are to befall
sinners or denunciations of the crimes of which they are guilty,
that the sinner may be saved, but sin destroyed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Prayer Of Thanksgiving Should Be Offered For All</h3>

<p>In the second part of prayer we render most grateful thanks to
God for the divine and immortal blessings which He has always
bestowed, and still continues to bestow every day on the human
race.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Our Thanksgiving Should Especially Be Offered: For
The Saints </h3>

<p>This duty we discharge especially when we give singular
praises to God for the victory and triumph which all the Saints,
aided by His goodness, have achieved over their domestic and
external enemies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>For The Blessed Virgin Mary</h3>

<p>To this sort of prayer belongs the first part of the Angelic
Salutation, when used by us as a prayer: Hail Mary, full of
grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women. For
in these words we render to God the highest praise and return Him
most gracious thanks, because He has bestowed all His heavenly
gifts on the most holy Virgin; and at the same time we
congratulate the Virgin herself on her singular privileges.</p>

<p> To this form of thanksgiving the Church of God has wisely
added prayers and an invocation addressed to the most holy Mother
of God, by which we piously and humbly fly to her patronage, in
order that, by her intercession, she may reconcile God to us
sinners and may obtain for us those blessings which we stand in
need of in this life and in the life to come. We, therefore,
exiled children of Eve, who dwell in this vale of tears, should
constantly beseech the Mother of mercy, the advocate of the
faithful, to pray for us sinners. In this prayer we should
earnestly implore her help and assistance; for that she possesses
exalted merits with God, and that she is most desirous to assist
us by her prayers, no one can doubt without impiety and
wickedness.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>To Whom We Should Pray</h3>

<h3>To God</h3>

<p>That God is to be prayed to and His name invoked is the
language of the law of nature, inscribed upon the human heart. It
is also the doctrine of Holy Scripture, in which we hear God
commanding: Call upon me in the day of trouble. By the word God,
we mean the three Persons (of the adorable Trinity). </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>To The Saints</h3>

<p>We must also have recourse to the intercession of the Saints
who are in glory. That the Saints are to be prayed to is a truth
so firmly established in the Church of God, that no pious person
can experience a shadow of doubt on the subject. But as this
point was explained in its proper place, under a separate head,
we refer the pastor and others to that place.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>God And The Saints Addressed Differently</h3>

<p>To remove, however, the possibility of error on the part of
the unlearned it will be found useful to explain to the faithful
the difference between these two kinds of invocation. </p>

<p> We do not address God and the Saints in the same manner, for
we implore God to grant us blessings or to deliver us from evils;
while we ask the Saints, since they are the friends of God, to
take us under their patronage and to obtain for us from God
whatever we need. Hence we make use of two different forms of
prayer. To God, we properly say: Have mercy on us, Hear us; but
to the Saints, Pray for us. Still we may also ask the Saints,
though in a different sense, that they have mercy on us, for they
are most merciful. Thus we may beseech them that, touched with
the misery of our condition, they would interpose in our behalf
their influence and intercession before God.</p>

<p> In the performance of this duty, it is strictly incumbent on
all not to transfer to any creature the right which belongs
exclusively to God. For instance, when we say the Our Father
before the image of a Saint we should bear in mind that we beg of
the Saint to pray with us and to obtain for us those favours
which we ask of God, in the Petitions of the Lord's Prayer, ­­
in a word, that he become our interpreter and intercessor with
God. That this is an office which the Saints discharge, St. John
the Apostle teaches in the Apocalypse.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Preparation for Prayer</h3>

<p>In Scripture we read: Before prayer, prepare thy soul, and be
not as a man that tempteth God. He tempts God who prays well but
acts badly, and while he converses with God allows his mind to
wander.</p>

<p> Since, then, the dispositions with which we pray are of such
vital importance, the pastor should teach his pious hearers how
to pray. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Humility</h3>

<p>The first preparation, then, for prayer is an unfeigned
humility of soul, an acknowledgment of our sinfulness, and a
conviction that, when we approach God in prayer, our sins render
us undeserving, not only of receiving a propitious hearing from
Him, but even of appearing in His presence.</p>

<p> This preparation is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures:
He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble, and he hath not
despised their petitions; the prayer of him that humbleth himself
shall pierce the clouds. Many other passages of the same kind
will suggest themselves to learned pastors. Hence we abstain from
citing more here.</p>

<p> Two examples, however, at which we have already glanced in
another place, and which are apposite to our purpose, we shall
not pass over in silence. The publican, who, standing afar off,
would not so much as lift up his eyes toward heaven, and the
woman, a sinner, who, moved with sorrow, washed the feet of
Christ the Lord, with her tears, illustrate the great efficacy
which Christian humility imparts to prayer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sorrow For Sin</h3>

<p>The next (preparation) is a feeling of sorrow, arising from
the recollection of our past sins, or, at least, some sense of
regret, that we do not experience that sorrow. If the sinner
bring not with him to prayer both, or, at least one of these
dispositions, he cannot hope to obtain pardon.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Freedom From Violence, Anger, Hatred And Inhumanity </h3>

<p>There are some crimes, such as violence and murder, which are
in a special way obstacles to the efficacy of our prayers, and we
must, therefore, preserve our hands unstained by outrage and
cruelty. Of such crimes the Lord says by the mouth of Isaias:
When you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from
you; and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear, for your
hands are full of blood</p>

<p> Anger and strife we should also avoid, for they have great
influence in preventing our prayers from being heard. Concerning
them the Apostle says: l will that men pray in every place
lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.</p>

<p> Implacable hatred of any person on account of injuries
received we must guard against; for while we are under the
influence of such feelings,­ it is impossible that we should
obtain from God the pardon of our sins. When you shall stand to
pray, He says, forgive, if you have aught against any man; and,
if you will not forgive men, neither will your heavenly Father
forgive you your offences.</p>

<p> Hardness and inhumanity to the poor we should also avoid. For
concerning men of this kind it was said He that stoppeth his ear
against the cry of the poor, shall also cry himself, and shall
not be heard.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Freedom From Pride And Contempt Of God's Word </h3>

<p>What shall we say of pride? How much it offends God, we learn
from these words: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to
the humble. What of the contempt of the divine oracles? He that
turneth away his ears, says Solomon, from hearing the law, his
prayer shall be an abomination.</p>

<p> Here, however, we are not to understand that we are forbidden
to pray for the forgiveness of the injuries we have done, of
murder, anger, insensibility to the wants of the poor, of pride,
contempt of God's word, in fine, of any other sin.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Faith And Confidence</h3>

<p>Faith is another necessary quality for this preparation of
soul. Without faith, we can have no knowledge of the omnipotence
or mercy of the supreme Father, which are the sources of our
confidence in prayer, as Christ the Lord Himself has taught: All
things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall
receive. St. Augustine, speaking of this faith, thus comments on
the Lord's words: Without faith prayer is useless.</p>

<p> The chief requisite, therefore, of a good prayer is, as we
have already said, a firm and unwavering faith. This the Apostle
shows by an antithesis: How shall they call on him whom they have
not believed? Believe, then, we must, both in order to pray, and
that we be not wanting in that faith which renders prayer
fruitful. For it is faith that leads to prayer, and it is prayer
that, by removing all doubts, gives strength and firmness to
faith. This is the meaning of the exhortation of St. Ignatius to
those who would approach God in prayer: Be not of doubtful mind
in prayer; blessed is he who hath not doubted. Wherefore, to
obtain from God what we ask, faith and an assured confidence, are
of first importance, according to the admonition of St. James:
Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Motives Of Confidence In Prayer</h3>

<p>There is much to inspire us with confidence in prayer. Among
these are to be numbered the beneficence and bounty of God,
displayed towards us, when He commands us to call Him Father,
thus giving us to understand that we are His children. Again
there are the numberless instances of those whose prayers have
been heard.</p>

<p> Further we have as our chief advocate, Christ the Lord, who
is ever ready to assist us, as we read in St. John: If any man
sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just;
and he is the propitiation for our sins.' In like manner Paul the
Apostle says: Christ Jesus, that died, yea, that is risen also
again, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us. To Timothy he writes: For there is one God,
and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus; and to the
Hebrews he writes: Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be
made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and
faithful high­priest before God. Unworthy, then, as we are, of
obtaining our requests, yet considering and resting our claims
upon the dignity of our great Mediator and Intercessor, Jesus
Christ, we should hope and trust most confidently, that, through
His merits, God will grant us all that we ask in the proper way.</p>

<p> Finally, the Holy Ghost is the author of our prayers; and
under His guiding influence, we cannot fail to be heard. We have
received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry,
&quot;Abba, (Father).&quot; This spirit succours our infirmity
and enlightens our ignorance in the discharge of the duty of
prayer; nay, even, as the Apostle says, He asketh for us with
unspeakable groanings.</p>

<p> Should we, then, at any time waver, not being sufficiently
strong in faith, let us say with the Apostles: Lord, increase our
faith; and, with the father (of the demoniac): Help my unbelief. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Correspondence With God's Will</h3>

<p>But what most ensures the accomplishment of our desires is the
union of faith and hope with that conformity of all our thoughts,
actions, and prayers to God's law and pleasure. If, He says, you
abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever
you will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fraternal Charity</h3>

<p>In order, however, that our prayers may have this power of
obtaining all things from God, we must, as was previously served,
forget injuries, cherish sentiments of good will, and practice
kindness towards our neighbour.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How to Pray Well</h3>

<p>The manner of praying is also a matter of the highest moment.
Though prayer in itself is good and salutary, yet if not
performed in a proper manner it is unavailing. Often we do not
obtain what we ask, because, in the words of St. James, we ask
amiss. Pastors, therefore, should instruct the faithful in the
best manner of asking well and of making private and public
prayer. The rules of Christian prayer have been formed on the
teaching of Christ the Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Must Pray In Spirit And In Truth</h3>

<p>We must, then pray in spirit and in truth; for the heavenly
Father seeks those who adore Him in spirit and in truth. He prays
in this manner whose prayer proceeds from an interior and intense
ardour of soul.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Mental Prayer</h3>

<p>This spiritual manner of praying does not exclude the use of
vocal prayer. Nevertheless, that prayer which is the vehement
outpouring of the soul, deservedly holds the first place; and
although not uttered with the lips, it is heard by God to whom
the secrets of hearts are open. He heard the silent prayer of
Anna, the mother of Samuel, of whom we read, that she prayed,
shedding many tears and only moving her lips. Such was also the
prayer of David, for he says: My heart hath said to thee, my f
ace hath sought thee. In reading the Bible one will meet many
similar examples.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Vocal Prayer</h3>

<p>But vocal prayer has also its advantages and necessity. It
quickens the attention of the mind, and kindles the fervour of
him who prays. We sometimes, says St. Augustine, in his letter to
Proba, animate ourselves to intensify our holy desire by having
recourse to words and other signs; filled with vehement ardour
and piety, we find it impossible at times not to express our
feelings in words; for while the soul exults with joy, the tongue
should also give utterance to that exultation. And surely it
becomes us to make to God this complete sacrifice of soul and
body, a kind of prayer which the Apostles were accustomed to use,
as we learn from many passages of the Acts and of the Apostle.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Private And Public Prayer</h3>

<p>There are two sorts of prayer, private and public. Private
prayer is employed in order to assist interior attention and
devotion; whereas in public prayer, which has been instituted to
excite the piety of the faithful, and has been prescribed for
certain fixed times, the use of words is indispensably required. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those Who Do Nor Pray In Spirit</h3>

<p>This practice of praying in spirit is peculiar to Christians,
and is not at all used by infidels. Of these Christ the Lord has
said: When you pray, speak not much, as the heathens; for they
think that in their much speaking they may be heard. Be not ye,
therefore, like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful
for you before you ask him.</p>

<p> But though (our Lord) prohibits loquacity, He is so far from
forbidding continuance in prayer which proceeds from the eager
and prolonged devotion of the soul that by His own example He
exhorts us to such prayer. Not only did He spend whole nights in
prayer, but also prayed the third time, saying the self­same
words. The inference, therefore, to be drawn from the prohibition
is that prayers consisting of mere empty sounds are not to be
addressed to God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Those Who Do Not Pray In Truth</h3>

<p>Neither do the prayers of the hypocrite proceed from the
heart; and against the imitation of their example, Christ the
Lord warns us in these words: When ye pray, ye shall not be as
the hypocrites that love to stand and pray in the synagogues, and
corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Amen I say,
to you they have received their reward. But thou, when thou shalt
pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to
thy Father in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret will
repay thee. Here the word chamber may be understood to mean the
human heart, which we should not only enter, but should also
close against every distraction from without that could deprive
our prayer of its perfection. For then will our heavenly Father,
who sees perfectly our hearts and secret thoughts, grant our
petitions. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Must Pray With Perseverance</h3>

<p>Another necessary condition of prayer is constancy. The great
efficacy of perseverance, the Son of God exemplifies by the
conduct of the judge, who, while he feared not God, nor regarded
man, yet, overcome by the persistence and importunity of the
widow, yielded to her entreaties.&quot; In our prayers to God we
should, therefore, be persevering.</p>

<p> We must not imitate the example of those who become tired of
praying, if, after having prayed once or twice, they succeed not
in obtaining the object of their prayers. We should never be
weary of the duty of prayer, as we are taught by the authority of
Christ the Lord and of the Apostle. And should the will at any
time fail us, we should beg of God by prayer the strength to
persevere.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Must Pray In The Name Of Jesus Christ</h3>

<p>The Son of God would also have us present our prayers to the
Father in His name; for, by His merits and the influence of His
mediation, our prayers acquire such weight that they are heard by
our heavenly Father. For He Himself says in St. John: Amen, Amen,
I say unto you, if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he
will give it you. Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my
name: ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full; and
again: Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will
I do.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Must Pray With Fervour, Uniting Petition To
Thanksgiving </h3>

<p>Let us imitate the fervour of the Saints in prayer; and to
petition let us unite thanksgiving, imitating the example of the
Apostles, who, as may be seen in the Epistles of St. Paul, always
observed this salutary practice.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fasting And Almsdeeds Should Be Joined To Prayer </h3>

<p>To prayer let us unite fasting and almsdeeds. Fasting is most
intimately connected with prayer. For the mind of one who is
filled with food and drink is so borne down as not to be able to
raise itself to the contemplation of God, or even to understand
what prayer means.</p>

<p> Almsdeeds have also an intimate connection with prayer. For
what claim has he to the virtue of charity, who, possessing the
means of affording relief to those who depend on the assistance
of others, refuses help to his neighbour and brother ? How can
he, whose heart is devoid of charity, demand assistance from God
unless, while imploring the pardon of his sins, he at the same
time humbly beg of God to grant him the virtue of charity ?</p>

<p> This triple remedy was, therefore, appointed by God to aid
man in the attainment of salvation. For by sin we offend God,
wrong our neighbour, or injure ourselves. The wrath of God we
appease by pious prayer; our offences against man we redeem by
almsdeeds; the stains of our own lives we wash away by fasting.
Each of these remedies, it is true, is applicable to every sort
of sin; they are, however, peculiarly adapted to those three
which we have specially mentioned.</p>
