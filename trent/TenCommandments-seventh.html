<h3>THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT : &quot;<i>Thou shalt not
steal</i>&quot; </h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment </h3>

<p>In the early ages of the Church, it was customary to impress
on the minds of hearers the nature and force of this Commandment.
This we learn from the reproof uttered by the Apostle against
some who were most earnest in deterring others from vices, in
which they themselves were found freely to indulge: Thou,
therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that
preachest that men should not steal, stealest. The salutary
effect of such instructions was not only to correct a vice then
very prevalent, but also to repress quarrels, litigation and
other evils which generally grow out of theft. Since in these our
days men are unhappily addicted to the same vices, with their
consequent misfortunes and evils, the pastor, following the
example of the holy Fathers and Doctors, should strongly insist
on this point and explain with diligent care the force and
meaning of this Commandment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>This Commandment A Proof Of The Love Of God Towards
Us And A Claim On Our Gratitude</h3>

<p>In the first place the pastor should exercise care and
industry in declaring the infinite love of God for man. Not
satisfied with having fenced round, so to say, our lives, our
persons and our reputation, by means of the two Commandments,
Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, God defends
and places a guard over our property and possessions, by adding
the prohibition, Thou shalt not steal. These words can have no
other meaning than that which we indicated above when speaking of
the other Commandments. They declare that God forbids our worldly
goods, which are placed under His protection, to be taken away or
injured by anyone.</p>

<p> Our gratitude to God, the author of this law, should be in
proportion to the greatness of the benefit the law confers upon
us. Now since the truest test of gratitude and the best means of
returning thanks, consists not only in lending a willing ear to
His precepts, but also in obeying them, the faithful are to be
animated and encouraged to an observance of this Commandment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Two Parts Of This Commandment</h3>

<p>Like the preceding Commandments, this one also is divided into
two parts. The first, which prohibits theft, is mentioned
expressly; while the spirit and force of the second, which en­
forces kindliness and liberality towards our neighbour, are
implied in the first part.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Negative Part of this Commandment</h3>

<h3>Stealing Forbidden</h3>

<p>We shall begin with the prohibitory part of the Commandment,
Thou shalt not steal. It is to be observed, that by the word
steal is understood not only the taking away of anything from its
rightful owner, privately and without his consent, but also the
possession of that which belongs to another, contrary to the
will, although not without the knowledge, of the true owner; else
we are prepared to say that He who prohibits theft does not also
prohibit robbery, which is accomplished by violence and
injustice, whereas, according to St. Paul, extortioners shall not
possess the kingdom of God, and their very company and ways
should be shunned, as the same Apostle writes.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Theft And Robbery Forbidden</h3>

<p>But though robbery is a greater sin than theft, inasmuch as it
not only deprives another of his property, but also offers
violence and insult to him; yet it cannot be a matter of surprise
that the divine prohibition is expressed under the milder word,
steal, instead of rob. There was good reason for this, since
theft is more general and of wider extent than robbery, a crime
which only they can commit who are superior to their neighbour in
brute force and power. Furthermore, it is obvious that when
lesser crimes are forbidden, greater enormities of the same sort
are also prohibited. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Various Names Given To Stealing</h3>

<p>The unjust possession and use of what belongs to another are
expressed by different names, according to the diversity of the
objects taken without the consent and knowledge of the owners To
take any private property from a private individual is called
theft; from the public, peculation. To enslave a freeman, or
appropriate the slave of another is called man­stealing. To
steal anything sacred is called sacrilege ­­ a crime most
enormous and sinful, yet so common in our days that what piety
and wisdom had set aside for the necessary expenses of divine
worship, for the support of the ministers of religion, and the
use of the poor is employed in satisfying individual avarice and
the worst passions. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Desire Of Stealing Forbidden</h3>

<p>But, besides actual theft, that is, the outward commission,
the will and desire are also forbidden by the law of God. The law
is spiritual and concerns the soul, the source of our thoughts
and designs. From the heart, says our Lord in St. Matthew, come
forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false testimonies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Gravity Of The Sin Of Stealing</h3>

<p>The grievousness of the sin of theft is sufficiently seen by
the light of natural reason alone, for it is a violation of
justice which gives to every man his own. The distribution and
allotment of property, fixed from the beginning by the law of
nations and confirmed by human and divine laws, must be
considered as inviolable, and each one must be allowed secure
possession of what justly belongs to him, unless we wish the
overthrow of human society. Hence these words of the Apostle:
Neither thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor
extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.</p>

<p> The long train of evils which this sin entails are a proof at
once of its mischievousness and enormity. It gives rise to hasty
and rash judgments, engenders hatred, originates enmities, and
sometimes subjects the innocent to cruel condemnation. </p>

<p> What shall we say of the necessity imposed by God on all of
satisfying for the injury done? Without restitution, says St.
Augustine, the sin is not forgiven. The difficulty of making such
restitution, on the part of those who have been in the habit of
enriching themselves with their neighbour's property, we may
learn not only from personal observation and reflection, but also
from the testimony of the Prophet Habacuc: Woe to him that
heapeth together what is not his own. How long also doth he load
himself with thick clay? The possession of other men's property
he calls thick clay, because it is difficult to emerge and
extricate one's self from (ill­gotten goods).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Chief Kinds Of Stealing</h3>

<p>There are so many kinds of stealing that it is most difficult
to enumerate them all; but since the others can be reduced to
theft and robbery, it will be sufficient to speak of these two.
To inspire the faithful with a detestation of such grievous
crimes and to deter them from their commission, the pastor should
use all care and diligence. Now let us consider these two kinds
of stealing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Various Forms Of Theft</h3>

<p>They are guilty of theft who buy stolen goods, or retain the
property of others, whether found, seized, or pilfered. If you
have found, and not restored, says St. Augustine, you have
stolen. If the true owner cannot, however, be discovered,
whatever is found should go to the poor. If the finder refuse to
make restitution, he gives evident proof that, were it in his
power, he would make no scruple of stealing all that he could lay
his hands on.</p>

<p> Those who, in buying or selling, have recourse to fraud and
lying, involve themselves in the same guilt. The Lord will avenge
their trickery. Those who sell bad and adulterated goods as real
and genuine, or who defraud the purchasers by weight, measure,
number, or rule, are guilty of a species of theft still more
criminal and unjust. It is written in Deuteronomy: Thou shalt not
have divers weights in thy bag. Do not any unjust thing, says
Leviticus, in judgment, in rule, in weight or in measure. Let the
balance be just, and the weights equal, the bushel just, and the
sextary equal. And elsewhere it is written: Divers weights are an
abomination before the Lord; a deceitful balance is not good.</p>

<p> It is, also, a downright theft, when labourers and artisans
exact full wages from those to whom they have not given just and
due labor. Again, dishonest servants and agents are no better
than thieves, nay they are more detestable than other thieves;
against these everything may be locked, while against a pilfering
servant nothing in a house can be secure by bolt or lock.</p>

<p> They, also, who obtain money under pretence of poverty, or by
deceitful words, may be said to steal, and their guilt is
aggravated since they add falsehood to theft.</p>

<p> Persons charged with offices of public or private trust, who
altogether neglect, or but indifferently perform their duties,
while they enjoy the salary and emoluments of such offices, are
also to be reckoned in the number of thieves.</p>

<p> To enumerate the various other modes of theft, invented by
the ingenuity of avarice, which is versed in all the arts of
making money, would be a tedious and, as already said, a most
difficult task.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Various Forms Of Robbery</h3>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should next come to treat of robbery,
which is the second general division of these crimes. First, he
should admonish the Christian people to bear in mind the teaching
of the Apostle: They that will become rich fall into temptation,
and the snare of the devil; and never to forget the rule: All
things whatsoever you will that men do to you, do you also to
them; and always to bear in mind the words of Tobias: See thou
never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee
by another.</p>

<p> Robbery is more comprehensive than theft. Those who pay not
the labourer his hire are guilty of robbery, and are exhorted to
repentance by St. James in these words: Go to now, ye rich men,
weep and howl for your miseries, which shall come upon you. He
adds the reason for their repentance: Behold the hire of the
labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has
been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered
into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. This sort of robbery is
strongly condemned in Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Malachy, and
Tobias. </p>

<p> Among those who are guilty of robbery are also included
persons who do not pay, or who turn to other uses or appropriate
to themselves, customs, taxes, tithes and such revenues, which
are owed to the Church or civil authorities.</p>

<p> To this class also belong usurers, the most cruel and
relentless of extortioners, who by their exorbitant rates of
interest, plunder and destroy the poor. Whatever is received
above the capital and principal, be it money, or anything else
that may be purchased or estimated by money, is usury; for it is
written in Ezechiel: He hath not lent upon usury, nor taken an
increase; and in Luke our Lord says: Lend, hoping for nothing
thereby. Even among the pagans usury was always considered a most
grievous and odious crime. Hence the question, &quot;What is
usury ?&quot; was answered: &quot;What is murder?&quot; And,
indeed, he who lends at usury sells the same thing twice, or
sells that which has no real existence. </p>

<p> Corrupt judges, whose decisions are venal, and who, bought
over by money or other bribes, decide against the just claims of
the poor and needy, also commit robbery.</p>

<p> Those who defraud their creditors, who deny their just debts,
and also those who purchase goods on their own, or on another's
credit, with a promise to pay for them at a certain time, and do
not keep their word, are guilty of the same crime of robbery. And
it is an aggravation of their guilt that, in consequence of their
want of punctuality and their fraud, prices are raised to the
great injury of the public. To such persons seem to apply the
words of David: The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again. </p>

<p> But what shall we say of those rich men who exact with rigour
what they lend to the poor, even though the latter are not able
to pay them, and who, disregarding God's law, take as security
even the necessary clothing of the unfortunate debtors ? For God
says: If thou take of thy neighbour a garment in pledge, thou
shalt give it him again before sunset, for that same is the only
thing wherewith he is covered, the clothing of his body, neither
hath he any other to sleep in: if he cry to me I will hear him,
because I am compassionate. Their rigorous exaction is justly
termed rapacity, and therefore robbery.</p>

<p> Among those whom the holy Fathers pronounced guilty of
robbery are persons who, in times of scarcity, hoard up their
corn, thus culpably rendering supplies scarcer and dearer. This
holds good with regard to all necessaries of life and sustenance.
These are they against whom Solomon utters this execration: He
that hideth up corn, shall be cursed among the people. Such
persons the pastor should warn of their guilt, and should reprove
with more than ordinary freedom; he should explain to them at
length the punishments which await such sins.</p>

<p> So much for what the seventh Commandment forbids. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Positive Part of this Commandment</h3>

<h3>Restitution Enjoined</h3>

<p>We now come to the positive part of this Commandment, in which
the first thing to be considered is satisfaction or restitution;
for without restitution the sin is not forgiven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Who Are Held To Restitution</h3>

<p>But as the law of making restitution to the injured party is
binding not only on the person who commits theft, but also on all
who cooperate in the sin, it is necessary to explain who are
indispensably bound to this satisfaction or restitution. There
are several classes (who are thus bound).</p>

<p> The first consists of those who order others to steal, and
who are not only the authors and accomplices of theft, but also
the most criminal among thieves.</p>

<p> Another class embraces those, who, when they cannot command
others to commit theft persuade and encourage it. These, since
they are like the first class in intention, though unlike them in
power, are equally guilty of theft.</p>

<p> A third class is composed of those who consent to the theft
committed by others.</p>

<p> The fourth class is that of those who are accomplices in, and
derive gain from theft; if that can be called gain, which, unless
they repent, consigns them to everlasting torments. Of them David
says: If thou didst see a thief, thou didst run with him.</p>

<p> The fifth class of thieves are those who, having it in their
power to prohibit theft, so far from opposing or preventing it,
fully and freely suffer and sanction its commission.</p>

<p> The sixth class is constituted of those who are well aware
that the theft was committed, and when it was committed; and yet,
far from mentioning it, pretend they know nothing about it.</p>

<p> The last class comprises all who assist in the accomplishment
of theft, who guard, defend, receive or harbour thieves.</p>

<p> All these are bound to make restitution to those from whom
anything has been stolen, and are to be earnestly exhorted to the
discharge of so necessary a duty.</p>

<p> Neither are those who approve and commend thefts entirely
innocent of this crime. Children also who steal from their
parents, and wives who steal from their husbands are not
guiltless of theft. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Almsdeeds Enjoined</h3>

<p>This Commandment also implies an obligation to sympathise with
the poor and needy, and to relieve their difficulties and
distresses by our means and good offices. Concerning this
subject, which cannot be insisted on too often or too strongly,
the pastor will find abundant matter to enrich his discourses in
the works of St. Cyprian, St. John Chrysostom, St. Gregory
Nazianzen, and other eminent writers on almsdeeds.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Inducements To Practice Almsgiving</h3>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should encourage the faithful to be
willing and anxious to assist those who have to depend on
charity, and should make them realise the great necessity of
giving alms and of being really and practically liberal to the
poor, by reminding them that on the last day God will condemn and
consign to eternal fires those who have omitted and neglected the
duty of almsgiving, while on the contrary He will praise and
introduce into His heavenly country those who have exercised
mercy towards the poor. These two sentences have been already
pronounced by the lips of Christ the Lord: Come, ye blessed of my
Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you; and: Depart front
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire. </p>

<p> Priests should also cite those texts which are calculated to
persuade (to the performance of this important duty): Give and it
shall be given to you. They should dwell on the promise of God,
the richest and most abundant that can be conceived: There is no
man who hath left house, or brethren, etc., that shall not
receive an hundred times as much now in this time and in the
world to come life everlasting; and he should add these words of
our Lord: Make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of iniquity,
that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting
dwellings. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ways Of Giving Alms</h3>

<p>They should also explain the parts of this necessary duty, so
that whoever is unable to give may at least lend to the poor what
they need to sustain life, according to the command of Christ our
Lord: Lend, hoping for nothing thereby. The happiness of doing
this is thus expressed by holy David: Acceptable is the man that
showeth mercy and lendeth.</p>

<p> But if we are not able to give to those who must depend on
the charity of others for their sustenance, it is an act of
Christian piety, as well as a means of avoiding idleness, to
procure by our labor and industry what is necessary for the
relief of the poor. To this the Apostle exhorts all by his own
example. For yourselves, he says to the Thessalonians, know how
you ought to imitate us; and again, writing to the same people:
Use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own
business, and work with your own, hands, as we commanded you; and
to the Ephesians: He that stole, let him steal no more; but
rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth
need.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Frugality Is Enjoined</h3>

<p>We should also practice frugality and draw sparingly on the
kindness of others, that we may not be burden or a trouble to
them. The exercise of considerateness is conspicuous in all the
Apostles, but preeminently so in St. Paul. Writing to the
Thessalonians he says: You remember, brethren, our labour and
toil; working night and day lest we should be chargeable to any
of you, we preached amongst you the gospel of God. And in another
place the same Apostle says: In labour and in toil, we worked
night and day, lest we should be burdensome to any of you.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sanction Of This Commandment</h3>

<h3>The Punishment Of Its Violation</h3>

<p>To inspire the faithful with an abhorrence of all infamous
sins against this Commandment, the pastor should have recourse to
the Prophets and the other inspired writers, to show the
detestation in which God holds the crimes of theft and robbery,
and the awful threats which He denounces against their
perpetrators. Hear this, exclaims the Prophet Amos, you that
crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail, saying:
&quot;When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares,
and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn; that we may lessen
the measure, and increase the sickle, and may convey in deceitful
balances? Many passages of the same kind may be found in
Jeremias, Proverbs,' and Ecclesiasticus. Indeed it cannot be
doubted that such crimes are the seeds from which have sprung in
great part the evils which in our times oppress society.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Reward Of Observing This Commandment</h3>

<p>That Christians may accustom themselves to those acts of
generosity and kindness towards the poor and the needy which are
inculcated by the second part of this Commandment, the pastor
should place before them those ample rewards which God promises
in this life and in the next to the beneficent and the bountiful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Excuses for Stealing Refuted</h3>

<p>As there are not wanting those who would even excuse their
thefts, these are to be admonished that God will accept no excuse
for sin; and that their excuses, far from extenuating, serve only
greatly to aggravate their guilt.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Rank And Position</h3>

<p>How insufferable the vanity of those men of exalted rank who
excuse themselves by alleging that they act not from cupidity or
avarice, but stoop to take what belongs to others only from a
desire to maintain the grandeur of their families and of their
ancestors, whose repute and dignity must fall, if not upheld by
the possession of another man's property. Of this harmful error
they are to be disabused; and they are to be convinced that the
only means to preserve and augment their wealth and to enhance
the glory of their ancestors is to obey the will of God and
observe His Commandments. Once His will and Commandments are
contemned, the stability of property, no matter how securely
settled, is overturned; kings are dethroned, and hurled from the
highest stations of honour; while the humblest individuals, men
too, towards whom they cherished the most implacable hatred, are
sometimes called by God to occupy their place.</p>

<p> It is incredible to what degree the divine wrath is kindled
against such offenders, and this we know from the testimony of
Isaias, who records these words of God: Thy princes are
faithless, companions of thieves; they all love bribes, they run
after rewards. Therefore, saith the Lord, the God of Hosts, the
mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my
adversaries; and I will be revenged of my enemies; and I will
turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dross.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Greater Ease And Elegance</h3>

<p>Some there are, who plead in justification of such conduct,
not the ambition of maintaining splendour and glory, but a desire
of acquiring the means of living in greater ease and elegance.
These are to be refuted, and should be shown how impious are the
words and conduct of those who prefer their own ease to the will
and the glory of God whom, by neglecting His Commandments, we
offend extremely. And yet what real advantage can there be in
theft? Of how many very serious evils is it not the source?
Confusion and repentance, says Ecclesiasticus, is upon a thief.
But even though no disadvantage overtake the thief, he offers an
insult to the divine name, opposes the most holy will of God, and
contemns His salutary precepts. From hence result all error, all
dishonesty, all impiety.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of The Other's Wealth</h3>

<p>But do we not sometimes hear the thief contend that he is not
guilty of sin, because he steals from the rich and the wealthy,
who, in his mind, not only suffer no injury, but do not even feel
the loss? Such an excuse is as wretched as it is baneful. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Force Of Habit</h3>

<p>Others imagine that they should be excused, because they have
contracted such a habit of stealing as not to be able easily to
refrain from such desires and practices. If such persons listen
not to the admonition of the Apostle: He that stole, let him now
steal no more, let them recollect that one day, whether they like
it or not, they will become accustomed to an eternity of
torments. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Favourable Opportunity</h3>

<p>Some excuse themselves by saying that the opportunity
presented itself. The proverb is well known: Those who are not
thieves are made so by opportunity. Such persons are to be
disabused of their wicked idea by reminding them that it is our
duty to resist every evil propensity. If we yield instant
obedience to every inordinate impulse, what measure, what limits
will there be to crime and disorder? Such an excuse, therefore,­
is of the lowest character, or rather is an avowal of a complete
want of restraint and justice. To say that you do not commit sin,
because you have no opportunity of sinning, is almost to
acknowledge that you are always prepared to sin when opportunity
offers.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Revenge</h3>

<p>There are some who say that they steal in order to gratify
revenge, having themselves suffered the same injury from others.
To such offenders it should be answered first of all that no one
is allowed to return injury for injury; next that no person can
be a judge in his own cause; and finally that still less can it
be lawful to punish one man for the wrong done you by another. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plea Of Financial Embarrassment</h3>

<p>Finally, some find a sufficient justification of theft in
their own embarrassments, alleging that they are overwhelmed with
debt, which they cannot pay off otherwise than by theft. Such
persons should be given to understand that no debt presses more
heavily upon all men than that which we mention each day in these
words of the Lord's Prayer: Forgive us our debts. Hence it is the
height of folly to be willing to increase our debt to God by new
sin, in order to be able to pay our debts to men. It is much
better to be consigned to prison than to be cast into the eternal
torments of hell; it is by far a greater evil to be condemned by
the judgment of God, than by that of man. Hence it becomes our
duty to have recourse to the assistance and mercy of God from
whom we can obtain whatever we need.</p>

<p> There are also other excuses, which, however, the judicious
and zealous pastor will not find it difficult to meet, so that
thus he may one day be blessed with a people who are followers of
good works.</p>
