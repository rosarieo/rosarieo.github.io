<h3><center>ARTICLE XI : &quot;THE RESURRECTION OF THE
BODY&quot;</center></h3>

<p>  </p>

<h3>Importance Of This Article</h3>

<p>That this Article supplies a convincing proof of the truth of
our faith appears chiefly from the fact that not only is it
proposed in the Sacred Scriptures to the belief of the faithful,
but is also confirmed by numerous arguments. This we scarcely
find to be the case with regard to the other Articles, which
justifies the inference that on this doctrine, as on its most
solid basis, rests our hope of salvation; for according to the
reasoning of the Apostle, If there be no resurrection of the
dead, then Christ is not risen again; and if Christ be not risen
again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. </p>

<p> The diligence and zeal, therefore, of the pastor in the
explanation of this dogma should not be less than the labor which
the impiety of many has expended in efforts to overthrow it. That
eminently important advantages flow to the faithful from the
knowledge of this Article will be shown further on.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;The Resurrection of the Body&quot;</h3>

<p>That in this Article the resurrection of mankind is called the
resurrection of the body, is a circumstance which deserves
special attention. It was not, indeed, so named without a reason
for the Apostles intended thus to convey a necessary truth, the
immortality of the soul. Lest anyone, despite the fact that many
passages of Scripture plainly teach that the soul is immortal,
might imagine that it dies with the body, and that both are to be
restored to life, the Creed speaks only of the resurrection of
the body.</p>

<p> Although in Sacred Scripture the word flesh often signifies
the whole man, as in Isaias, All flesh is grass, and in St. John,
The Word was made flesh; yet in this place it is used to express
the body only, thus giving us to understand that of the two
constituent parts of man, soul and body, one only, that is, the
body, is corrupted and returns to its original dust, while the
soul remains incorrupt and immortal. As then, a man cannot be
said to return to life unless he has previously died, so the soul
could not with propriety be said to rise again.</p>

<p> The word body is also mentioned, in order to confute the
heresy of Hymeneus and Philetus, who, during the lifetime of the
Apostle, asserted that whenever the Scriptures speak of the
resurrection, they are to be understood to mean not the
resurrection of the body, but that of the soul, by which it rises
from the death of sin to the life of grace. The words of this
Article, therefore, as is clear, exclude that error, and
establish a real resurrection of the body.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Fact of the Resurrection:</h3>

<h3>Examples And Proofs Derived From Scripture</h3>

<p>It will be the duty of the pastor to illustrate this truth by
examples taken from the Old and New Testaments, and from all
ecclesiastical history. In the Old Testament, some were restored
to life by Elias and Eliseus; and, besides those who were raised
to life by our Lord, many were raised by the holy Apostles and by
many others. These many resurrections confirm the doctrine taught
by this Article; for believing that many were recalled from death
to life, we are also naturally led to believe the general
resurrection of all. In fact the principal fruit which we should
derive from these miracles is to yield to this Article our most
unhesitating belief. </p>

<p> To pastors ordinarily conversant with the Sacred Volumes many
Scripture proofs of this Article will at once present themselves.
In the Old Testament the most conspicuous are those afforded by
Job, when he says that in his flesh he shall see his God, and by
Daniel when, speaking of those who sleep in the dust of the
earth, he says, some shall awake to eternal life, others to
eternal reproach. In the New Testament (the principal passages
are) those of St. Matthew, which record the disputation our Lord
held with the Sadducees, and those in which the Evangelists speak
concerning the Last Judgment. To these we may also add the
accurate reasoning of the Apostle on the subject in his Epistles
to the Corinthians and Thessalonians.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Analogies From Nature</h3>

<p>But although the resurrection is most certainly established by
faith, it will, notwithstanding, be of material advantage to show
from analogy and reason that what faith proposes is not at
variance with nature or human reason.</p>

<p> To one asking how the dead should rise again, the Apostle
answers: Foolish man! that which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die first; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
the body that shall be, but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some
of the rest; but God giveth it a body as he will; and a little
after, It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption. </p>

<p> St. Gregory calls our attention to many other arguments of
analogy tending to the same effect. The sun, he says, is every
day withdrawn from our eyes, as it were, by dying, and is again
recalled, as it were, by rising again; trees lose, and again, as
it were, by a resurrection, resume their verdure; seeds die by
putrefaction, and rise again by germination.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Arguments Drawn From Reason</h3>

<p>The reasons also adduced by ecclesiastical writers seem well
calculated to establish this truth. In the first place, as the
soul is immortal, and has, as part of man, a natural propensity
to be united to the body, its perpetual separation from it must
be considered as unnatural. But as that which is contrary to
nature and in a state of violence, cannot be permanent, it
appears fitting that the soul should be reunited to the body, and
consequently that the body should rise again. This argument our
Saviour Himself employed, when in His disputation with the
Sadducees He deduced the resurrection of the body from the
immortality of the soul.&quot; </p>

<p> In the next place, as an all­just God holds out punishments
to the wicked and rewards to the good, and as very many of the
former depart this life unpunished for their crimes and many of
the latter unrewarded for their virtues, the soul should be
reunited to the body, in order, as the partner of her crimes, or
the companion of her virtues, to become a sharer in her
punishments or rewards. This argument has been admirably treated
by St. Chrysostom in his homily to the people of Antioch. </p>

<p> To this effect also, the Apostle, speaking of the
resurrection, says: If in this life only, we have hope in Christ,
we are of all men the most miserable.. These words of St. Paul
cannot be supposed to refer to the misery of the soul; for since
the soul is immortal, it is capable of enjoying happiness in a
future life, even though the body did not rise again. His words,
then, must refer to the whole man; for, unless the body receive
the due rewards of its labours, those who, like the Apostles,
endured so many afflictions and calamities in this life, would
necessarily be the most miserable of men. On this subject the
Apostle is much more explicit in his Epistle to the
Thessalonians: We glory in the churches of God, for your patience
and faith, in all your persecutions and tribulations which you
endure ­­ for an example of the just judgment of God, that you
may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you
suffer; seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation
to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with
us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the
angels of his power, in a flame of fire, yielding vengeance to
them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ. </p>

<p> Again, while the soul is separated from the body, man cannot
enjoy that full happiness which is replete with every good. For
as a part separated from the whole is imperfect, the soul
separated from the body must be imperfect. Therefore, that
nothing may be wanting to fill up the measure of its happiness,
the resurrection of the body is necessary.</p>

<p> By these, and similar arguments, the pastor will be able to
instruct the faithful in this Article.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>All Shall Rise</h3>

<p>He should also carefully explain from the Apostle who are to
be raised to life. Writing to the Corinthians, he (St. Paul)
says: As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made
alive.' Good and bad then, without distinction, shall all rise
from the dead, although the condition of all will not be the
same. Those who have done good, shall rise to the resurrection of
life; and those who have done evil to the resurrection of
judgment. </p>

<p> When we say all we mean those who will have died before the
day of judgment, as well as those who will then die. That the
Church acquiesces in the opinion that all, without distinction,
shall die, and that this opinion is more consonant with truth, is
the teaching of St. Jerome and of St. Augustine.</p>

<p> Nor does the Apostle in his Epistle to the Thessalonians
dissent from this doctrine, when he says: The dead who are in
Christ shall rise first, then we who are alive, who are left,
shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet
Christ, into the air. St. Ambrose explaining these words says: In
that very taking up, death shall take place, as it were, in a
deep sleep, and the soul, having gone forth from the body, shall
instantly return. For those who are alive shall die when they are
taken up that, coming to the Lord, they may receive their souls
from His presence; because in His presence they cannot be dead.
This opinion is supported by the authority of St. Augustine in
his book On the City of God.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Body Shall Rise Substantially the Same</h3>

<p>But as it is of vital importance to be fully convinced that
the identical body, which belongs to each one of us during life,
shall, though corrupt and dissolved into its original dust, be
raised up again to life, this too is a subject which demands
accurate explanation on the part of the pastor.</p>

<p> It is a truth conveyed by the Apostle when he says: This
corruptible must put on incorruption, evidently designating by
the word this, his own body. It is also clearly expressed in the
prophecy of Job: In my flesh I shall see my God, whom I myself
shall see, and mine eyes behold, and not another.</p>

<p> Further, this same truth is inferred from the very definition
of resurrection; for resurrection, as Damascene defines it, is a
return to the state from which one has fallen.</p>

<p> Finally, if we bear in mind the arguments by which we have
just established a future resurrection, every doubt on the
subject must at once disappear.</p>

<p> We have said that the body is to rise again, that every one
may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath
done, whether it be good or evil. Man is, therefore, to rise
again in the same body with which he served God, or was a slave
to the devil; that in the same body he may experience rewards and
a crown of victory, or endure the severest punishments and
torments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Restoration Of All That Pertains To The Nature And
Adornment Of The Body</h3>

<p>Not only will the body rise, but whatever belongs to the
reality of its nature, and adorns and ornaments man will be
restored. For this we have the admirable words of St. Augustine:
There</p>

<p> shall then be no deformity of body; if some have been
overburdened with flesh, they shall not resume its entire weight.
All that exceeds the proper proportion shall be deemed
superfluous. On the other hand, should the body be wasted by
disease or old age, or be emaciated from any other cause, it
shall be repaired by the divine power of Christ, who will not
only restore the body unto us, but will repair whatever it shall
have lost through the wretchedness of this life. In another place
he says: Man shall not resume his former hair, but shall be
adorned with such as will become him, according to the words:
&quot;The very hairs of your head are all numbered.&quot; God
will restore them according to His wisdom.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Restoration Of All That Pertains To The Integrity Of
The Body </h3>

<p>But the members especially, because they belong to the
integrity of human nature, shall all be restored at once. The
blind from nature or disease, the lame, the maimed and the
paralysed in any of their members shall rise again with entire
and perfect bodies. Otherwise the desires of the soul, which so
strongly incline it to a union with the body, would be far from
satisfied; but we are convinced that in the resurrection these
desires will be fully realised.</p>

<p> Besides, the resurrection, like the creation, is clearly to
be numbered among the principal works of God. As, therefore, at
the creation all things came perfect from the hand of God, we
must admit that it will be the same in the resurrection.</p>

<p> These observations are not to be restricted to the bodies of
the martyrs, of whom St. Augustine says: As the mutilation which
they suffered would prove a deformity, they shall rise with all
their members; otherwise those who were beheaded would rise
without a head. The scars, however, which they received shall
remain, shining like the wounds of Christ, with a brilliance far
more resplendent than that of gold and of precious stones.</p>

<p> The wicked, too, shall rise with all their members, even with
those lost through their own fault. The greater the number of
members which they shall have, the greater will be their
torments; and therefore this restoration of members will serve to
increase not their happiness but their sorrow and misery; for
merit or demerit is ascribed not to the members, but to the
person to whose body they are united. To those, therefore, who
shall have done penance, they shall be restored as sources of
reward; and to those who shall have contemned it, as instruments
of punishment. </p>

<p> If the pastor gives attentive consideration to these things,
he can never lack words or ideas to move the hearts of the
faithful, and enkindle in them the flame of piety; so that having
before their minds the troubles and calamities of this life, they
may look forward with eager expectations to that blessed glory of
the resurrection which awaits the just.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Condition of the Risen Body Shall be Different </h3>

<p>It now remains for the faithful to understand how the body,
when raised from the dead, although substantially the same body
that had been dead, shall be vastly different and changed in its
condition. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Immortality</h3>

<p>To omit other points, the chief difference between the state
of all bodies when risen from the dead and what they had
previously been is that before the resurrection they were subject
to dissolution, but when reanimated they shall all, without
distinction of good and bad, be invested with immortality.</p>

<p> This admirable restoration of nature, as the Scriptures
testify, is the result of the glorious victory of Christ over
death. For it is written: He shall cast death down headlong for
ever, and, O death! I will be thy death.' Explaining these words
the Apostle says: And the enemy death shall be destroyed last;
and St. John also says: Death shall be no more.</p>

<p> It was most fitting that the sin of Adam should be far
exceeded by the merit of Christ the Lord, who overthrew the
empire of death. It was also in keeping with divine justice, that
the good should enjoy endless felicity, while the wicked,
condemned to everlasting torments, shall seek death, and shall
not find it, shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them.
Immortality, therefore, will be common to the good and to the
bad.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Qualities Of A Glorified Body</h3>

<p>In addition to this, the bodies of the risen Saints will be
distinguished by certain transcendent endowments, which will
ennoble them far beyond their former condition. Among these
endowments four are specially mentioned by the Fathers, which
they infer from the doctrine of St. Paul, and which are called
gifts.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Impassibility</h6>

<p> The first endowment or gift is impassibility, which shall
place them beyond the reach of suffering anything disagreeable or
of being affected by pain or inconvenience of any sort. Neither
the piercing severity of cold, nor the glowing intensity of heat,
nor the impetuosity of waters can hurt them. It is sown says the
Apostle, in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption This
quality the Schoolmen call impassibility, not incorruption, in
order to distinguish it as a property peculiar to a glorified
body. The bodies of the damned, though incorruptible, will not be
impassible; they will be capable of experiencing heat and cold
and of suffering various afflictions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Brightness</h6>

<p> The next quality is brightness, by which the bodies of the
Saints shall shine like the sun, according to the words of our
Lord recorded in the Gospel of St. Matthew: The just shall shine
as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. To remove the
possibility of doubt on the subject, He exemplifies this in His
Transfiguration. This quality the Apostle sometimes calls glory,
sometimes brightness: He will reform the body of our lowness,
made like to the body of his glory; &quot; and again, It is sown
in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. Of this glory the
Israelites beheld some image in the desert, when the face of
Moses, after he had enjoyed the presence and conversation of God,
shone with such lustre that they could not look on it.</p>

<p> This brightness is a sort of radiance reflected on the body
from the supreme happiness of the soul. It is a participation in
that bliss which the soul enjoys just as the soul itself is
rendered happy by a participation in the happiness of God.</p>

<p> Unlike the gift of impassibility, this quality is not common
to all in the same degree. All the bodies of the Saints will be
equally impassible; but the brightness of all will not be the
same, for, according to the Apostle, One is the glory of the sun,
another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the
stars, for star differeth from star in glory: so also is the
resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Agility</h6>

<p> To the preceding quality is united that which is called
agility, by which the body will be freed from the heaviness that
now presses it down, and will take on a capability of moving with
the utmost ease and swiftness, wherever the soul pleases, as St.
Augustine teaches in his book On the City of God, and St. Jerome
On Isaias. Hence these words of the Apostle: It is sown in
weakness, it shall rise in power.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Subtility</h6>

<p> Another quality is that of subtility, which subjects the body
to the dominion of the soul, so that the body shall be subject to
the soul and ever ready to follow her desires. This quality we
learn from these words of the Apostle: It is sown a natural body,
it shall rise a spiritual body.</p>

<p> These are the principal points which should be dwelt on in
the exposition of this Article.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Advantages of Deep Meditation on this Article </h3>

<p>But in order that the faithful may appreciate the fruit they
derive from a knowledge of so many and such exalted mysteries, it
is necessary, first of all, to point out that to God, who has
hidden these things from the wise and made them known to little
ones, we owe a debt of boundless gratitude. How many men, eminent
for wisdom or endowed with singular learning, who ever remained
blind to this most certain truth ! The fact, then, that He has
made known to us these truths, although we could never have
aspired to such knowledge, obliges us to pour forth our gratitude
in unceasing praises of His supreme goodness and clemency.</p>

<p> Another important advantage to be derived from reflection on
this Article is that in it we shall find consolation both for
ourselves and others when we mourn the death of those who were
endeared to us by relationship or friendship. Such was the
consolation which the Apostle himself gave the Thessalonians when
writing to them concerning those who are asleep.</p>

<p> Again, in all our afflictions and calamities the thought of a
future resurrection must bring the greatest relief to the
troubled heart, as we learn from the example of holy Job, who
supported his afflicted and sorrowing soul by this one hope that
the day would come when, in the resurrection, he would behold the
Lord his God.</p>

<p> The same thought must also prove a powerful incentive to the
faithful to use every exertion to lead lives of rectitude and
integrity, unsullied by the defilement of sin. For if they
reflect that those boundless riches which will follow after the
resurrection are now offered to them as rewards, they will be
easily attracted to the pursuit of virtue and piety.</p>

<p> On the other hand, nothing will have greater effect in
subduing the passions and withdrawing souls from sin, than
frequently to remind the sinner of the miseries and torments with
which the reprobate will be visited, who on the last day will
come forth unto the resurrection of judgment.</p>
