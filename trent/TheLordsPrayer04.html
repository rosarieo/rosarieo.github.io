<h3><center>THE FOURTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER: <i>&quot;GIVE
US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD&quot;</center></i></h3>

<h3>The Relation Of The Following Petitions To Those That
Preceded </h3>

<p>The fourth and following Petitions, in which we particularly
and expressly pray for the needs of soul and body, are
subordinate to those which preceded. According to the order of
the Lord's Prayer we ask for what regards the body and the
preservation of life after we have prayed for the things which
pertain to God. For since man has God as his last end, the goods
of human life should be subordinated to those that are divine.
These goods should be desired and prayed for, either because the
divine order so requires, or because we need them to obtain
divine blessings, that being assisted by these (temporal things)
we may reach our destined end, the kingdom and glory of our
heavenly Father, and the reverential observance of those commands
which we know to emanate from His holy will. In this Petition,
therefore, we should refer all to God and His glory.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How To Pray For Temporal Blessings</h3>

<p>In the discharge of his duty towards the faithful the pastor,
therefore, should endeavour to make them understand that, in
praying for the use and enjoyment of temporal blessings, our
minds and our desires are to be directed in conformity with the
law of God, from which we are not to swerve in the least. By
praying for the transient things of this world, we especially
transgress; for, as the Apostle says, We know not what we should
pray for as we ought. These things, therefore, we should pray for
as we ought, lest, praying for anything as we ought not, we
receive from God for answer, You know not what you ask.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Means Of Ascertaining Purity Of Intention In Offering
This Petition</h3>

<p>A sure standard for judging what petition is good, and what
bad, is the purpose and intention of the petitioner. Thus if a
person prays for temporal blessings under the impression that
they constitute the sovereign good, and rests in them as the
ultimate end of his desires, wishing nothing else, he
unquestionably does not pray as he ought. As St. Augustine
observes, we ask not these temporal things as our goods, but as
our necessaries. The Apostle also in his Epistle to the
Corinthians teaches that whatever regards the necessary purposes
of life is to be referred to the glory of God: Whether you eat or
drink, or whatever else you do, do all to the glory of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity of the Fourth Petition</h3>

<p>In order that the faithful may see the importance of this
Petition, the pastor should remind them how much we stand in need
of external things, in order to support and maintain life; and
this they will the more easily understand, if he compares the
wants of our first parent with those of his posterity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Man Needs Many Things For His Bodily Life</h3>

<p>It is true that in that exalted state of innocence, from which
he himself, and, through his transgression, all his posterity
fell, he had need of food to recruit his strength; yet there is a
great difference between his wants and those to which we are
subject. He stood not in need of clothes to cover him, of a house
to shelter him, of weapons to defend him, of medicine to restore
health, nor of many other things which are necessary to us for
the protection and preservation of our weak and frail bodies. To
enjoy immortality, it would have been sufficient for him to eat
of the fruit which the blessed tree of life yielded without any
labor from him or his posterity.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, since he was placed in that habitation of
pleasure in order to be occupied, he was not, in the midst of
these delights, to lead a life of indolence. But to him no
employment would have been troublesome, no duty unpleasant. From
the cultivation of those beautiful gardens he would always have
derived fruits the most delicious, and his labours and hopes
would never have been frustrated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>To Supply His Bodily Wants Man Must Labor</h3>

<p>His posterity, on the contrary, are not only deprived of the
fruit of the tree of life, but also condemned to this dreadful
sentence: Cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil
shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life; thorns and
thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the
herbs of the earth. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread, till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast
taken; for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Without God's Help Man's Labor Is Vain</h3>

<p>Our condition, therefore, is entirely different from what his
and that of his posterity would have been, had Adam listened to
the voice of God. All things have been thrown into disorder, and
have changed sadly for the worse. Of the resultant evils, this is
not the least, that the heaviest cost, and labor, and toil, are
frequently expended in vain; either because the crops are
unproductive, or because the fruits of the earth are smothered by
noxious weeds that spring up about them, or perish when stricken
and prostrated by heavy rains, storms, hail, blight or blast.
Thus is the entire labor of the year quickly reduced to nothing
by some calamity of air or soil, inflicted in punishment of our
crimes, which provoke the wrath of God and prevent Him from
blessing our efforts. The dreadful sentence pronounced against us
in the beginning remains.</p>

<p> Pastors, therefore, should apply themselves earnestly to the
treatment of this subject, in order that the faithful may know
that men fall into these perplexities and miseries through their
own fault; that they may understand that while they must sweat
and toil to procure the necessaries of life, unless God bless
their labours, their hope must prove fallacious, and all their
exertions unavailing. For neither he that planteth is anything,
nor he that watereth but God who giveth the increase; unless the
Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Inducements to Use this Petition</h3>

<p>Parish priests, therefore, should point out that the things
necessary to human existence, or, at least, to its comfort, are
almost innumerable; for by this knowledge of our wants and
weaknesses, Christians will be compelled to have recourse to
their heavenly Father, and humbly to ask of Him both earthly and
spiritual blessings.</p>

<p> They will imitate the prodigal son, who, when he began to
suffer want in a far distant country, and could find no one to
give him even husks in his hunger, at length entering into
himself, perceived that from the evils by which he was oppressed,
he could expect relief from no one but from his father.</p>

<p> Here the faithful will also have recourse more confidently to
prayer, if, in reflecting on the goodness of God, they recollect
that His paternal ears are ever open to the cries of His
children. When He exhorts us to ask for bread, He promises to
bestow it on us abundantly, if we ask it as we ought; for, by
teaching us how to ask, He exhorts; by exhorting, He urges; by
urging, He promises; by promising, He puts us in hope of most
certainly obtaining our request.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Bread&quot;</h3>

<p>When, therefore, the faithful are thus animated and
encouraged, (the pastor) should next proceed to declare the
objects of this Petition; and first, what that bread is which we
ask. </p>

<p> It should then be known that, in the Sacred Scriptures, by
the word bread, are signified many things, but especially two:
first, whatever we use for food and for other corporal wants;
secondly, whatever the divine bounty has bestowed on us for the
life and salvation of the soul.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Ask For Temporal Blessings</h3>

<p>In this Petition, then, according to the interpretation and
authority of the holy Fathers, we ask those helps of which we
stand in need in this life on earth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>It Is Lawful To Pray For Temporal Blessings</h3>

<p>Those, therefore, who say that it is unlawful for Christians
to ask from God the earthly goods of this life, are by no means
to be listened to; for not only the unanimous teaching of the
Fathers, but also very many examples, both in the Old and New
Testaments, are opposed to this error.</p>

<p> Thus Jacob, making a vow, prayed as follows: If God shall be
with me, and shall keep me in the way, by which I walk, and shall
give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, and I shall return
prosperously to my father's house, the Lord shall be my God, and
this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall be called the
house of God; and of all things thou shalt give to me, I will
offer up tithes to thee. Solomon also asked a certain means of
subsistence in this life, when he prayed: Give me neither beggary
nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life.</p>

<p> Nay, the Saviour of mankind Himself commands us to pray for
those things which no one will dare deny appertain to the benefit
of the body. Pray, He says, that your flight be not in the
winter, or on the sabbath. St. James also says: Is any one of you
sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him, sing. And the
Apostle thus addressed himself to the Romans: I beseech you,
brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of
the Holy Ghost, that you assist me in your prayers for me to God,
that l may be delivered front the unbelievers that are in Judea.
As, then, the faithful are divinely permitted to ask these
temporal succours, and as this perfect form of prayer was given
us by Christ the Lord, there remains no doubt that such a request
constitutes one of the seven Petitions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Wants, Not The Luxuries Of This Life Are Meant By
The Word &quot;Bread&quot;</h3>

<p>We also ask our daily bread; that is, the things necessary for
sustenance, understanding by the word bread, what is sufficient
for raiment and for food, whether that food be bread,­ or flesh,
or fish, or anything else. In this sense we find Eliseus to have
used the word when admonishing the king to provide bread for the
Assyrian soldiers, to whom was then given a large quantity of
various kinds of food. We also know that of Christ the Lord it is
written, that He went into the house of a certain prince of the
Pharisees on the sabbath day to eat bread, by which words we see
are signified the things that constitute food and drink. </p>

<p> To comprehend the full signification of this Petition, it is,
moreover, to be observed that by this word bread ought not to be
understood an abundant and exquisite profusion of food and
clothing, but what is necessary and simple, as the Apostle has
written: Having food and wherewith to he covered, with these we
are content; and Solomon, as said above: Give me only the
necessaries of life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Our&quot;</h3>

<p>Of this frugality and moderation we are admonished in the next
word; for when we say our, we ask for bread sufficient to satisfy
our necessities, not to gratify luxury.</p>

<p> We do not say our in the sense that we are able of ourselves,
and independently of God, to procure bread; for we read in David:
All expect of thee that thou give them food in season: when thou
givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand
they shall all be filled with good; and in another place, The
eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord, and thou givest them meat in
due season. (We say our bread, then), because it is necessary for
us and is given to us by God, the Father of all, who, by His
providence, feeds all living creatures.</p>

<p> It is­also called our bread for this reason, that it is to
be acquired by us lawfully, not by injustice, fraud or theft.
What we procure in evil ways is not our own, but the property of
another. Its acquisition or possession, or, at least, its loss,
is generally calamitous; while, on the contrary, there is in the
honest and laborious gains of good men peace and great happiness,
according to these words of the Prophet: For thou shalt eat the
labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with
thee. Indeed to those who seek subsistence by honest labor, God
promises the fruit of His kindness in the following passage: The
Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses, and upon
all the works of thy hands, and will bless thee.</p>

<p> Not only do we beg of God to grant us to use, with the aid of
His goodness, the fruit of our virtuous toil ­­ and that is
truly called ours ­­ but we also pray for a good mind, that we
may be able well and prudently to use what we have honestly
acquired.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Daily&quot;</h3>

<p>By the word (daily) also is suggested the idea of frugality
and moderation, to which we referred a short time ago; for we
pray not for variety or delicacy of food, but for that which may
satisfy the wants of nature. This should bring the blush of shame
to those who, disdaining ordinary food and drink, look for the
rarest viands and wines.</p>

<p> Nor by this word daily are they less censured to whom Isaias
holds out those awful threats: Woe to you that join house to
house, and lay field to field, even to the end of the place:
shall you alone dwell in the midst of the earth? Indeed the
cupidity of such men is insatiable, and it is of them that
Solomon has written: A covetous man shall­not be satisfied with
money. To them also applies that saying of the Apostle: They who
would become rich fall into temptation, and into the snare of the
devil.</p>

<p> We also call it our daily bread, because we use it to recruit
the vital power that is daily consumed by the natural heat of the
system.</p>

<p> Finally, another reason for the use of the word daily is the
necessity of continually praying to God, in order that we may be
kept in the practice of loving and serving Him, and that we may
be thoroughly convinced of the fact that on Him depend our life
and salvation. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Give&quot;</h3>

<p>With regard to the two words give us, what ample matter they
supply for exhorting the faithful piously and holily to worship
and revere the infinite power of God, in whose hands are all
things, and to detest that abominable boast of Satan: To me all
things are delivered, and to whom I will I give them, must be
obvious to everyone. For it is by the sovereign will of God alone
that all things are dispensed, and preserved, and increased. </p>

<p> But what necessity, some one may say, is there imposed on the
rich to pray for their daily bread, seeing that they abound in
all things? They are under the necessity of praying thus, not
that those things be given them which by the goodness of God they
have in abundance, but that they may not lose their possessions.
Hence the Apostle writes that the rich should learn from this not
to be highminded, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the
living God, who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy. </p>

<p> St. Chrysostom adduces as a reason for the necessity of this
Petition, not only that we may be supplied with food, but that we
be supplied with it by the hand of the Lord, which imparts to our
daily bread so wholesome and salutary an influence as to render
the food profitable to the body, and the body subject to the
soul.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;us&quot;</h3>

<p>But why say give us, in the plural number, and not give me?
Because it is the duty of Christian charity that each individual
be not solicitous for himself alone, but that he be also active
in the cause of his neighbour; and that, while he attends to his
own interests, he forget not the interests of others. </p>

<p> Moreover, the gifts which are bestowed by God on anyone are
given, not that he alone should possess them, or that he should
live luxuriously in their enjoyment, but that he should impart
his superfluities to others. For, as St. Basil and St. Ambrose
say, It is the bread of the hungry that you withhold; it is the
clothes of the naked that you lock up; that money you bury under
ground is the redemption, the freedom of the wretched. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;This Day&quot;</h3>

<p>The words this day remind us of our common infirmity. For who
is there that, although he does not expect to be able by his own
individual exertions to provide for his maintenance during a
considerable time does not feel confident of having it in his
power to procure necessary food for the day? Yet even this
confidence God will not permit us to entertain, but has commanded
us to ask Him for the food even of each successive day; and the
necessary reason is, that as we all stand in need of daily bread,
each should also make daily use of the Lord's Prayer.</p>

<p> So far we have spoken of the bread which we eat and which
nourishes and supports the body; which is common to believers and
unbelievers, to pious and impious, and is bestowed on all by the
admirable bounty of God, Who maketh his sun to rise on the good
and the bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Spiritual Bread Asked for in this Petition </h3>

<p>It remains to speak of the spiritual bread which we also ask
in this Petition, by which are meant all things whatever that are
required in this life for the health and safety of the spirit and
soul. For as the food by which the body is nourished and
supported is of various sorts, so is the food which preserves the
life of the spirit and soul not of one kind.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Word Of God Is Our Spiritual Bread</h3>

<p>The Word of God is the food of the soul, as Wisdom says: Come,
eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.
And when God deprives men of the means of hearing His Word, which
He is wont to do when grievously provoked by our crimes, He is
said to visit the human race with famine; for we thus read in
Amos: I will send forth a famine into the land, not a famine of
bread, or a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.
</p>

<p> And as an incapability of taking food, or of retaining it
when taken, is a sure sign of approaching death, so is it a
strong argument for their hopelessness of salvation, when men
either seek not the Word of God, or, having it, endure it not,
but utter against God the impious cry, Depart from us, We desire
not the knowledge of thy ways. This is the spiritual folly and
mental blindness of those who, disregarding their lawful pastors,
the Catholic Bishops and priests, and, abandoning the Holy Roman
Church, have transferred themselves to the direction of heretics
that corrupt the Word of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Christ Is Our Spiritual Bread, Especially In The Holy
Eucharist </h3>

<p>Now Christ the Lord is that bread which is the food of the
soul. I am, He says of Himself, the living bread which came down
from heaven. It is incredible with what pleasure and delight this
bread fills devout souls, even when they must contend with
earthly troubles and disasters. Of this we have an example in the
Apostles, of whom it is written: They, indeed, went into the
presence of the council rejoicing. The lives of the Saints are
full of similar examples; and of these inward joys of the good,
God thus speaks: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden
manna.</p>

<p> But Christ the Lord is especially our bread in the Sacrament
of the Eucharist, in which He is substantially contained. This
ineffable pledge of His love He gave us when about to return to
the Father, and of it He said: He that eateth my flesh, and
drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him, Take ye and eat:
this is my body. For matter useful to the faithful on this
subject the pastor should consult what we have already said on
the nature and efficacy of this Sacrament.</p>

<p> The Eucharist is called our bread, because it is the food of
the faithful only, that is to say, of those who, uniting charity
to faith, wash away the defilement of their sins in the Sacrament
of Penance, and mindful that they are the children of God,
receive and adore this divine Sacrament with all possible
holiness and veneration.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why The Holy Eucharist Is Called Our
&quot;Daily&quot; Bread </h3>

<p>The Eucharist is called daily (bread) for two reasons. The
first is that it is daily offered to God in the sacred mysteries
of the Christian Church and is given to those who seek it piously
and holily. The second is that it should be received daily, or,
at least, that we should so live as to be worthy, as far as
possible, to receive it daily. Let those who hold the contrary,
and who say that we should not partake of this salutary banquet
of the soul but at distant intervals, hear what St. Ambrose says:
If it is daily bread, why do you receive it yearly?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Exhortations</h3>

<p>In the explanation of this Petition the faithful are
emphatically to be exhorted that when they have honestly used
their best judgment and industry to procure the necessary means
of subsistence, they leave the issue to God and submit their own
wish to the will of Him who shall not suffer the just to waver
for ever. For God will either grant what is asked, and thus they
will obtain their wishes; or He will not grant it, and that will
be a most certain proof that what is denied the good by Him is
not conducive either to their interest or their salvation, since
He is more desirous of their eternal welfare than they
themselves. This topic the pastor will be able to amplify, by
explaining the reasons admirably collected by St. Augustine in
his letter to Proba.</p>

<p> In concluding his explanation of this Petition the pastor
should exhort the rich to remember that they are to look upon
their wealth and riches as gifts of God, and to reflect that
those goods are bestowed on them in order that they may share
them with the indigent. With this truth the words of the Apostle,
in his First Epistle to Timothy,' will be found to accord, and
will supply parish priests with an abundance of matter wherewith
to elucidate this subject in a useful and profitable manner.</p>
