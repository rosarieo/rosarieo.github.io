<h3><center>THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM</center></h3>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On Baptism</h3>

<p>From what has been hitherto said on the Sacraments in general,
we may judge how necessary it is, to a proper understanding of
the doctrines of the Christian faith and to the practice of
Christian piety, to know what the Catholic Church proposes for
our belief on each Sacrament in particular.</p>

<p> Whoever reads the Apostle carefully will unhesitatingly
conclude that a perfect knowledge of Baptism is particularly
necessary to the faithful. For not only frequently, but also in
language the most energetic, in language full of the Spirit of
God, he renews the recollection of this mystery, declares its
divine character, and in it places before us the death, burial
and Resurrection of. our Lord as objects both of our
contemplation and imitation. </p>

<p> Pastors, therefore, can never think that they have bestowed
sufficient labor and attention on the exposition of this
Sacrament. Besides the Vigils of Easter and Pentecost, days on
which the Church used to celebrate this Sacrament with the
greatest devotion and special solemnity, and on which
particularly, according to ancient practice, its divine mysteries
were to be explained, pastors should also take occasion at other
times to make it the subject of their instructions. </p>

<p> For this purpose a most convenient opportunity would seem to
present itself whenever a pastor, being about to administer this
Sacrament, finds himself surrounded by a considerable number of
the faithful. On such occasions, it is true, his exposition
cannot embrace everything that regards Baptism; but it will then
be much easier to develop one or two points when the faithful </p>

<p> can contemplate with a pious and attentive mind the meaning
of those things which they hear and at the same time see it
illustrated by the sacred ceremonies of Baptism. Each person,
reading a lesson of admonition in the person of him who is
receiving Baptism, will call to mind the promises by which he
bound himself to God when he was baptised, and will reflect
whether his life and conduct have been such as are promised by
the profession of Christianity. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Names of this Sacrament </h3>

<p>In order that the treatment of the subject. may be clear, we
must explain the nature and substance of Baptism, premising,
however, an explanation of the word itself.</p>

<p> The word baptism, as is well known, is of Greek derivation.
Although used in Sacred Scripture to express not only that
ablution which forms part of the Sacrament, but also every
species of ablution, and sometimes, figuratively, to express
sufferings; yet it is employed by ecclesiastical writers to
designate not every sort of bodily ablution, but that which forms
part of the Sacrament and is administered with the prescribed
form of words. In this sense the Apostles very frequently make
use of the word in accordance with the institution of Christ the
Lord.</p>

<p> This Sacrament the holy Fathers designate also by other
names. St. Augustine informs us that it was sometimes called the
Sacrament of Faith, because by receiving it we profess our faith
in all the doctrines of Christianity.</p>

<p> By others it was termed Illumination, because by the faith
which we profess in Baptism the heart is illumined; for as the
Apostle also says, alluding to the time of Baptism, Call to mind
the former days, wherein, being illumined, you endured a great
fight of afflictions Chrysostom, in his sermon to the baptised,
calls it a purgation, because through it we purge away the old
leaven, that we may become a new paste. He also calls it a
burial, a planting, and the cross of Christ, the reasons for all
which appellations may be gathered from the Epistle to the
Romans.</p>

<p> St. Denis calls it the beginning of the most holy
Commandments, for this obvious reason, that Baptism is, as it
were, the gate through which we enter into the fellowship of the
Christian life, and begin thenceforward to obey the Commandments.
So much should be briefly explained concerning the name (of this
Sacrament) . </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Definition Of Baptism</h3>

<p>With regard to the definition of Baptism although many can be
given from sacred writers, nevertheless that which may be
gathered from the words of our Lord recorded in John, and of the
Apostle to the Ephesians, appears the most appropriate and
suitable. Unless, says our Lord, a man be born again of water and
the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God; and,
speaking of the Church, the Apostle says, cleansing it by the
laver of water in the word of life. Thus it follows that Baptism
may be rightly and accurately defined: The Sacrament of
regeneration by water in the word. By nature we are born from
Adam children of wrath, but by Baptism we are regenerated in
Christ, children of mercy. For He gave power to men to be made
the sons of God, to them that believe in his name, who are born,
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Constituent Elements Of Baptism</h3>

<p>But define Baptism as we may, the faithful are to be informed
that this Sacrament consists of ablution, accompanied
necessarily, according to the institution of our Lord, by certain
solemn words. This is the uniform doctrine of the holy Fathers,
as is proved by the following most explicit testimony of St.
Augustine: The word is joined to the element, and it becomes a
Sacrament. </p>

<p> It is all the more necessary to impress this on the minds of
the faithful lest they fall into the common error of thinking
that the baptismal water, preserved in the sacred font,
constitutes the Sacrament. The Sacrament of Baptism can be said
to exist only when we actually apply the water to someone by way
of ablution, while using the words appointed by our Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Matter of Baptism</h3>

<p>Now since we said above, when treating of the Sacraments in
general, that every Sacrament consists of matter and form, it is
therefore necessary that pastors point out what constitutes each
of these in Baptism. The matter, then, or element of this
Sacrament, is any sort of natural water, which is simply and
without qualification commonly called water, be it sea water,
river water, water from a pond, well or fountain.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Testimony Of Scripture Concerning The Matter Of
Baptism</h3>

<p>For the Saviour taught that unless a man be born again of
water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God. The Apostle also says that the Church was cleansed by the
laver of water; and in the Epistle of St. John we read these
words: There are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit,
and the water, and the blood. Scripture affords other proofs
which establish the same truth.</p>

<p> When, however, John the Baptist says that the Lord will come
who will baptise in the Holy Ghost, and in fire, that is by no
means to be understood of the matter of Baptism; but should be
applied either to the interior operation of the Holy Ghost, or at
least to the miracle performed on the day of Pentecost, when the
Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles in the form of fire, as was
foretold by Christ our Lord in these words: John indeed baptised
with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost, not
many days hence. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>The same was also signified by the Lord both by figures and by
prophecies, as we know from Holy Scripture. According to the
Prince of the Apostles in his first Epistle, the deluge which
cleansed the world because the wickedness of men was great on the
earth, and all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil, was
a figure and image of this water. To omit the cleansing of Naaman
the Syrian, and the admirable virtue of the pool of Bethsaida,
and many similar types, manifestly symbolic of this mystery, the
passage through the Red Sea, according to St. Paul in his Epistle
to the Corinthians, was typical of this same water.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Prophecies</h3>

<p>With regard to the predictions, the waters to which the
Prophet Isaias so freely invites all that thirst, and those which
Ezechiel in spirit saw issuing from the Temple, and also the
fountain which Zachary foresaw, open to the house of David, and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the sinner,
and of the unclean woman, were, no doubt, intended to indicate
and express the salutary waters of Baptism.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fitness</h3>

<p>The propriety of constituting water the matter of Baptism, of
the nature and efficacy of which it is at once expressive, St.
Jerome, in his Epistle to Oceanus, proves by many arguments. </p>

<p> Upon this subject pastors can teach in the first place that
water, which is always at hand and within the reach of all, was
the fittest matter of a Sacrament which is necessary to all for
salvation. In the next place water is best adapted to signify the
effect of Baptism. It washes away uncleanness, and is, therefore,
strikingly illustrative of the virtue and efficacy of Baptism,
which washes away the stains of sin. We may also add that, like
water which cools the body, Baptism in a great measure
extinguishes the fire of concupiscence.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Chrism Added To Water For Solemn Baptism</h3>

<p>But it should be noted that while in case of necessity simple
water unmixed with any other ingredient is sufficient for the
matter of this Sacrament, yet when Baptism is administered in
public with solemn ceremonies the Catholic Church, guided by
Apostolic tradition, has uniformly observed the practice of
adding holy chrism which, as is clear, more fully signifies the
effect of Baptism. The people should also be taught that although
it may sometimes be doubtful whether this or that water be
genuine, such as the perfection of the Sacrament requires, it can
never be a subject of doubt that the only matter from which the
Sacrament of Baptism can be formed is natural water.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Form of Baptism</h3>

<p>Having carefully explained the matter, which is one of the two
parts of which Baptism consists, pastors must show equal
diligence in explaining the form, which is the other essential
part. In the explanation of this Sacrament a necessity of
increased care and study arises, as pastors will perceive, from
the circumstance that the knowledge of so holy a mystery is not
only in itself a source of pleasure to the faithful, as is
generally the case with regard to religious knowledge, but also
very desirable for almost daily practical use. As we shall
explain in its proper place, circumstances often arise where
Baptism requires to be administered by the laity, and most
frequently by women; and it therefore becomes necessary to make
all the faithful, indiscriminately, well acquainted with whatever
regards the substance of this Sacrament. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Words Of The Form</h3>

<p>Pastors, therefore, should teach, in clear, unambiguous
language, intelligible to every capacity, that the true and
essential form of Baptism is: I baptise thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. For so it was
delivered by our Lord and Saviour when, as we read in St. Matthew
He gave to His Apostles the command: Going, . . . teach ye all
nations: baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> By the word baptising, the Catholic Church, instructed from
above, most justly understood that the form of the Sacrament
should express the action of the minister; and this takes place
when he pronounces the words, I baptise thee.</p>

<p> Besides the minister of the Sacrament, the person to be
baptised and the principal efficient cause of Baptism should be
mentioned. The pronoun thee, and the distinctive names of the
Divine Persons are therefore added. Thus the complete form of the
Sacrament is expressed in the words already mentioned: I baptise
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.</p>

<p> Baptism is the work not of the Son alone, of whom St. John
says, He it is that baptizeth, but of the Three Persons of the
Blessed Trinity together. By saying, however, in the name, not in
the names, we distinctly declare that in the Trinity there is but
one Nature and Godhead. The word name is here referred not to the
Persons, but to the Divine Essence, virtue and power, which are
one and the same in Three Persons.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Essential And Non­Essential Words Of The Form</h3>

<p>It is, however, to be observed that of the words contained in
this form, which we have shown to be the complete and perfect
one, some are absolutely necessary, so that the omission of them
renders the valid administration of the Sacrament impossible;
while others on the contrary, are not so essential as to affect
its validity.</p>

<p> Of the latter kind is the word ego (I), the force of which is
included in the word baptizo (I baptise). Nay more, the Greek
Church, adopting a different manner of expressing the form, and
being of opinion that it is unnecessary to make mention of the
minister, omits the pronoun altogether. The form universally used
in the Greek Church is: Let this servant of Christ be baptised in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. It
appears, however, from the decision and definition of the Council
of Florence, that those who use this form administer the
Sacraments validly, because the words sufficiently express what
is essential to the validity of Baptism, that is, the ablution
which then takes place.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism In The Name Of Christ</h3>

<p>If at any time the Apostles baptised in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ only, we can be sure they did so by the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, in order, in the infancy of the Church, to
render their preaching more illustrious by the name of Jesus
Christ, and to proclaim more effectually His divine and infinite
power. If, however, we examine the matter more closely, we shall
find that such a form omits nothing which the Saviour Himself
commands to be observed; for he who mentions Jesus Christ implies
the Person of the Father, by whom, and that of the Holy Ghost, in
whom, He was anointed.</p>

<p> And yet, the use of this form by the Apostles seems rather
doubtful if we accept the opinions of Ambrose and Basil, holy
Fathers eminent for sanctity and authority, who interpret baptism
in the name of Jesus Christ to mean the Baptism instituted by
Christ our Lord, as distinguished from that of John, and who say
that the Apostles did not depart from the ordinary and usual form
which comprises the distinct names of the Three Persons. Paul
also, in his Epistle to the Galatians, seems to have expressed
himself in a similar manner, when he says: As many of you as have
been baptised in Christ, have put on Christ, meaning that they
were baptised in the faith of Christ, but with no other form than
that which the same Saviour our Lord had commanded to be
observed. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Administration of Baptism</h3>

<p>What has been said on the matter and form, which are required
for the essence of the Sacrament, will be found sufficient for
the instruction of the faithful; but as in the administration of
the Sacrament the legitimate manner of ablution should also be
observed, pastors should teach the doctrine of this­point also.</p>

<p> They should briefly explain that, according to the common
custom and practice of the Church, Baptism may be administered in
three ways, ­­ by immersion, infusion or aspersion. </p>

<p> Whichever of these rites be observed, we must believe that
Baptism is rightly administered. For in Baptism water is used to
signify the spiritual ablution which it accomplishes, and on this
account Baptism is called by the Apostle a laver. Now this
ablution is not more really accomplished by immersion, which was
for a considerable time the practice in the early ages of the
Church, than by infusion, which we now see in general use, or by
aspersion, which there is reason to believe was the manner in
which Peter baptised, when on one day he converted and gave
Baptism to about three thousand souls.</p>

<p> It is a matter of indifference whether the ablution be
performed once or thrice. For it is evident from the Epistle of
St. Gregory the Great to Leander that Baptism was formerly and
may still be validly administered in the Church in either way.
The faithful, however, should follow the practice of the
particular Church to which they belong.</p>

<p> Pastors should be particularly careful to observe that the
baptismal ablution is not to be applied indifferently to any part
of the body, but principally to the head, which is the seat of
all the internal and external senses; and also that he who
baptises is to pronounce the sacramental words which constitute
the form, not before or after, but when performing the ablution. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Institution Of Baptism</h3>

<p>When these things have been explained, it will also be
expedient to teach and remind the faithful that, in common with
the other Sacraments, Baptism was instituted by Christ the Lord.
On this subject the pastor should frequently teach and point out
that there are two different periods of time which relate to
Baptism, ­­ one the period of its institution by the Redeemer;
the other, the establishment of the law regarding its reception. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism Instituted At Christ's Baptism</h3>

<p>With regard to the former, it is clear that this Sacrament was
instituted by our Lord when, having been baptised by John, He
gave to water the power of sanctifying. St. Gregory Nazianzen and
St. Augustine · testify that to water was then. imparted the
power of regenerating to spiritual life. In another place St.
Augustine says: From the moment that Christ is immersed in water,
water washes away all sins. And again: The Lord is baptised, not
because He had need to be cleansed, but in order that, by the
contact of His pure flesh, He might purify the waters and impart
to them the power of cleansing.</p>

<p> A very strong argument to prove that Baptism was then
instituted by our Lord might be afforded by the fact the most
Holy Trinity, in whose name Baptism is conferred, manifested Its
divine presence on that occasion. The voice of the Father was
heard, the Person of the Son was present, the Holy Ghost
descended in the form of a dove; and the heavens, into which we
are enabled to enter by Baptism, were thrown open.</p>

<p> Should anyone desire to know how our Lord has endowed water
with a virtue so great, so divine, this indeed transcends the
power of the human understanding. Yet this we can know, that when
our Lord was baptised, water, by contact with His most holy and
pure body, was consecrated to the salutary use of Baptism, in
such a way, however, that, although instituted before the
Passion, we must believe that this Sacrament derives all its
virtue and efficacy from the Passion, which is the consummation,
as it were, of all the actions of Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism Made Obligatory After Christ's Resurrection </h3>

<p>The second period to be distinguished, that is, the time when
the law of Baptism was made, also admits of no doubt. Holy
writers are unanimous in saying that after the Resurrection of
our Lord, when He gave to His Apostles the command to go and
teach all nations: baptising them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, the law of Baptism became
obligatory on all who were to be saved.</p>

<p> This is inferred from the authority of the Prince of the
Apostles when he says: Who hath regenerated us into a lively
hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead;' and
also from what Paul says of the Church: He delivered himself up
for it: that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of
water in the word of life. By both Apostles the obligation of
Baptism seems to be referred to the time which followed the death
of our Lord. Hence we can have no doubt that the words of the
Saviour: Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, refer also to the same
time which was to follow after His Passion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>If, then, pastors explain these truths accurately, there can
be no doubt that the faithful will recognise the high dignity of
this Sacrament and venerate it with the most profound piety,
particularly when they reflect that each of them receives in
Baptism by the interior operation of the Holy Ghost the same
glorious and most ample gifts which were so strikingly manifested
by miracles at the Baptism of Christ the Lord.</p>

<p> Were our eyes, like those of the servant of Eliseus, opened
to see heavenly things, who can be supposed so senseless as not
to be lost in rapturous admiration of the divine mysteries of
Baptism ! When, therefore, the riches of this Sacrament are
unfolded to the faithful by the pastor, so as to enable them to
behold them, if not with the eyes of the body, yet with those of
the soul illumined by the light of faith, may we not anticipate
similar results ? </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ministers of Baptism</h3>

<p>In the next place, it appears not only expedient, but
necessary to say who are ministers of this Sacrament; both in
order that those to whom this office is specially confided may
study to perform its functions religiously and holily; and that
no one, outstepping, as it were, his proper limits, may
unseasonably take possession of, or arrogantly assume, what
belongs to another; for, as the Apostle teaches, order is to be
observed in all things. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Bishops And Priests The Ordinary Ministers</h3>

<p>The faithful, therefore, are to be informed that of those (who
administer Baptism) there are three gradations. Bishops and
priests hold the first place. To them belongs the administration
of this Sacrament, not by any extraordinary concession of power,
but by right of office; for to them, in the persons of the
Apostles, was addressed the command of our Lord: Go, baptise.
Bishops, it is true, in order not to neglect the more weighty
charge of instructing the faithful, have generally left its
administration to priests. But the authority of the Fathers and
the usage of the Church prove that priests exercise this function
by their own right, so much so that they may baptise even in the
presence of the Bishop. Ordained to consecrate the Holy
Eucharist, the Sacrament of peace and unity, it was fitting that
they be invested with power to administer all those things which
are required to enable others to participate in that peace and
unity. If, therefore, the Fathers have at any time said that
without the leave of the Bishop the priest has not the right to
baptise, they are to be understood to speak of that Baptism only
which was administered on certain days of the year with solemn
ceremonies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Deacons Extraordinary Ministers Of Baptism</h3>

<p>Next among the ministers are deacons, for whom, as numerous
decrees of the holy Fathers attest it is not lawful without the
permission of the Bishop or priest to administer this Sacrament. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ministers In Case Of Necessity</h3>

<p>Those who may administer Baptism in case of necessity, but
without its solemn ceremonies, hold the last place; and in this
class are included all, even the laity, men and women, to
whatever sect they may belong. This office extends in case of
necessity, even to Jews, infidels and heretics, provided,
however, they intend to do what the Catholic Church does in that
act of her ministry. These things were established by many
decrees of the ancient Fathers and Councils; and the holy Council
of Trent denounces anathema against those who dare to say, that
Baptism, even when administered by heretics, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, with the intention
of doing what the Church does, is not true Baptism.</p>

<p> And here indeed let us admire the supreme goodness and wisdom
of our Lord. Seeing the necessity of this Sacrament for all, He
not only instituted water, than which nothing can be more common,
as its matter, but also placed its administration within the
power of all. In its administration, however, as we have already
observed, all are not allowed to use the solemn ceremonies; not
that rites and ceremonies are of higher dignity, but because they
are less necessary than the Sacrament.</p>

<p> Let not the faithful, however, imagine that this office is
given promiscuously to all, so as to do away with the propriety
of observing a certain precedence among those who are its
ministers. When a man is present a woman should not baptise; an
ecclesiastic takes precedence over a layman, and a priest over a
simple ecclesiastic. Midwives, however, when accustomed to its
administration, are not to be found fault with if sometimes, when
a man is present who is unacquainted with the manner of its
administration, they perform what may otherwise appear to belong
more properly to men. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Sponsors at Baptism</h3>

<p>Besides the ministers who, as just explained, confer Baptism,
another class of persons, according to the most ancient practice
of the Church, is admitted to assist at the baptismal font. In
former times these were commonly called by sacred writers
receivers, sponsors or sureties, and are now called godfathers
and godmothers. As this is an office pertaining almost to all the
laity, pastors should explain it with care, so that the faithful
may understand what is chiefly necessary for its proper
performance. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why Sponsors Are Required At Baptism</h3>

<p>In the first instance it should be explained why at Baptism,
besides those who administer the Sacrament, godparents and
sponsors are also required. The propriety of the practice will at
once appear to all if they recollect that Baptism is a spiritual
regeneration by which we are born children of God; for of it St.
Peter says: As newborn infants, desire the rational milk without
guile. As, therefore, every one, after his birth, requires a
nurse and instructor by whose assistance and attention he is
brought up and formed to learning and useful knowledge, so those,
who, by the waters of Baptism, begin to live a spiritual life
should be entrusted to the fidelity and prudence of some one from
whom they may imbibe the precepts of the Christian religion and
may be brought up in all holiness, and thus grow gradually in
Christ, until, with the Lord's help, they at length arrive at
perfect manhood.</p>

<p> This necessity must appear still more imperative, if we
recollect that pastors, who are charged with the public care of
parishes have not sufficient time to undertake the private
instruction of children in the rudiments of faith.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Antiquity Of This Law</h3>

<p>Concerning this very ancient practice we have this noteworthy
testimony of St. Denis: It occurred to our divine leaders (so he
called the Apostles), and they in their wisdom ordained that
infants should be introduced (into the Church) in this holy
manner that their natural parents should deliver them to the care
of some one well skilled in divine things, as to a master under
whom, as a spiritual father and guardian of his salvation in
holiness, the child should lead the remainder of his life. The
same doctrine is confirmed by the authority of Hyginus.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Affinity Contracted By Sponsors</h3>

<p>The Church, therefore, in her wisdom has ordained that not
only the person who baptises contracts a spiritual affinity with
the person baptised, but also the sponsor with the godchild and
its natural parents, so that between all these marriage cannot be
lawfully contracted, and if contracted, it is null and void. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Duties Of Sponsors</h3>

<p>The faithful are also to be taught the duty of sponsors; for
such is the negligence with which this office is treated in the
Church that only the bare name of the function remains, while
none seem to have the least idea of its sanctity. Let all
sponsors, then, at all times recollect that they are strictly
bound by this law to exercise a constant vigilance over their
spiritual children, and carefully to instruct them in the maxims
of a Christian life; so that these may show themselves throughout
life to be what their sponsors promised in the solemn ceremony.</p>

<p> On this subject let us hear the words of St. Denis. Speaking
in the person of the sponsor he says: I promise, by my constant
exhortations to induce this child, when he comes to a knowledge
of religion, to renounce every thing opposed (to his Christian
calling) and to profess and perform the sacred promises which he
now makes. </p>

<p> St. Augustine also says: I most especially admonish you, men
and women, who have acquired godchildren through Baptism, to
consider that you stood as sureties before God, for those whom
you received at the sacred font. Indeed it preeminently becomes
every man, who undertakes any office, to be indefatigable in the
discharge of its duties; and he who promised to be the teacher
and guardian of another should never allow to be deserted him
whom he once received under his care and protection as long as he
knows the latter to stand in need of either.</p>

<p> Speaking of this same duty of sponsors, St. Augustine sums up
in a few words the lessons of instruction which they are bound to
impart to their spiritual children. They ought, he says, to
admonish them to observe chastity, love justice, cling to
charity; and above all they should teach them the Creed, the
Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the rudiments of the
Christian religion. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Who May Not Be Sponsors</h3>

<p>It is easy, therefore, to decide who are inadmissible to this
holy guardianship, that is, those who are unwilling to discharge
its duties with fidelity, or who cannot do so with care and
accuracy. </p>

<p> Wherefore, besides the natural parents, who, to mark the
great difference that exists between this spiritual and the
carnal bringing up of youth, are not permitted to undertake this
charge, heretics, Jews and infidels are on no account to be
admitted to this office, since their thoughts and efforts are
continually employed in darkening by falsehood the true faith and
in subverting all Christian piety. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Number Of Sponsors</h3>

<p>The number of sponsors is limited by the Council of Trent to
one godfather or one godmother, or at most, to a godfather and a
godmother; because a number of teachers may confuse the order of
discipline and instruction, and also because it was necessary to
prevent the multiplication of affinities which would impede a
wider diffusion of society by means of lawful marriage.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity of Baptism</h3>

<p>If the knowledge of what has been hitherto explained be, as it
is, of highest importance to the faithful, it is no less
important to them to learn that the law of Baptism, as
established by our Lord, extends to all, so that unless they are
regenerated to God through the grace of Baptism, be their parents
Christians or infidels, they are born to eternal misery and
destruction. Pastors, therefore, should often explain these words
of the Gospel: Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy
Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Infant Baptism: It's Necessity</h3>

<p>That this law extends not only to adults but also to infants
and children, and that the Church has received this from
Apostolic tradition, is confirmed by the unanimous teaching and
authority of the Fathers.</p>

<p> Besides, it is not to be supposed that Christ the Lord would
have withheld the Sacrament and grace of Baptism from children,
of whom He said: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not
to come to me; for the kingdom of heaven is for such; ° whom
also He embraced, upon whom He imposed hands, to whom He gave His
blessing.</p>

<p> Moreover, when we read that an entire family was baptised by
Paul, it is sufficiently obvious that the children of the family
must also have been cleansed in the saving font. </p>

<p> Circumcision, too, which was a figure of Baptism, affords
strong argument in proof of this practice. That children were
circumcised on the eighth day is universally known. If then
circumcision, made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the
flesh, was profitable to children, it is clear that Baptism,
which is the circumcision of Christ, not made by hand, is also
profitable to them.</p>

<p> Finally, as the Apostle teaches, if by one man's offence
death reigned through one, much more they who receive abundance
of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life
through one, Jesus Christ. If, then, through the transgression of
Adam, children inherit original sin, with still stronger reason
can they attain through Christ our Lord grace and justice that
they may reign in life. This, however, cannot be effected
otherwise than by Baptism. </p>

<p> Pastors, therefore, should inculcate the absolute necessity
of administering Baptism to infants, and of gradually forming
their tender minds to piety by education in the Christian
religion. For according to these admirable words of the wise man:
A young man according to his way, even when he is old, he will
not depart from it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Infants Receive The Graces Of Baptism</h3>

<p>It may not be doubted that in Baptism infants receive the
mysterious gifts of faith. Not that they believe with the assent
of the mind, but they are established in the faith of their
parents, if the parents profess the true faith; if not--to use
the words of St. Augustine--then in that of the universal society
of the saints; for they are rightly said to be presented for
Baptism by all those to whom their initiation in that sacred rite
is a source of joy, and by whose charity they are united to the
communion of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism Of Infants Should Not Be Delayed</h3>

<p>The faithful are earnestly to be exhorted to take care that
their children be brought to the church, as soon as it can be
done with safety, to receive solemn Baptism. Since infant
children have no other means of salvation except Baptism, we may
easily understand how grievously those persons sin who permit
them to remain without the grace of the Sacrament longer than
necessity may require, particularly at an age so tender as to be
exposed to numberless dangers of death.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism Of Adults</h3>

<p>With regard to those of adult age who enjoy the perfect use of
reason, persons, namely, born of infidel parents, the practice of
the primitive Church points out that a different manner of
proceeding should be followed. To them the Christian faith is to
be proposed; and they are earnestly to be exhorted, persuaded and
invited to embrace it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>They Should Not Delay Their Baptism Unduly</h3>

<p>If converted to the Lord God, they are then to be admonished
not to defer the Sacrament of Baptism beyond the time prescribed
by the Church. For since it is written, delay not to be converted
to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day, they are to be
taught that in their regard perfect conversion consists in
regeneration by Baptism. Besides, the longer they defer Baptism,
the longer are they deprived of the use and graces of the other
Sacraments, by which the Christian religion is practised, since
the other Sacraments are accessible through Baptism only.</p>

<p> They are also deprived of the abundant fruits of Baptism, the
waters of which not only wash away all the stains and defilements
of past sins, but also enrich us with divine grace which enables
us to avoid sin for the future and preserve righteousness and
innocence, which constitute the sum of a Christian life, as all
can easily understand.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ordinarily They Are Not Baptised At Once</h3>

<p>On adults, however, the Church has not been accustomed to
confer the Sacrament of Baptism at once, but has ordained that it
be deferred for a certain time. The delay is not attended with
the same danger as in the case of infants, which we have already
mentioned; should any unforeseen accident make it impossible for
adults to be washed in the salutary waters, their intention and
determination to receive Baptism and their repentance for past
sins, will avail them to grace and righteousness.</p>

<p> Nay, this delay seems to be attended with some advantages.
And first, since the Church must take particular care that none
approach this Sacrament through hypocrisy and dissimulation, the
intentions of such as seek Baptism, are better examined and
ascertained. Hence it is that we read in the decrees of ancient
Councils that Jewish converts to the Catholic faith, before
admission to Baptism, should spend some months in the ranks of
the catechumens.</p>

<p> Furthermore, the candidate for Baptism is thus better
instructed in the doctrine of the faith which he is to profess,
and in the practices of the Christian life. Finally, when Baptism
is administered to adults with solemn ceremonies on the appointed
days of Easter and Pentecost only greater religious reverence is
shown to the Sacrament.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>In Case Of Necessity Adults May Be: Baptised At Once</h3>

<p>Sometimes, however, when there exists a just and necessary
cause, as in the case of imminent danger of death, Baptism is not
to be deferred, particularly if the person to be baptised is well
instructed in the mysteries of faith. This we find to have been
done by Philip, and by the Prince of the Apostles, when without
any delay, the one baptised the eunuch of Queen Candace; the
other, Cornelius, as soon as they expressed a wish to embrace the
faith. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Dispositions for Baptism</h3>

<h3>Intention</h3>

<p>The faithful are also to be instructed in the necessary
dispositions for Baptism. In the first place they must desire and
intend to receive it; for as in Baptism we all die to sin and
resolve to live a new life, it is fit that it be administered to
those only who receive it of their own free will and accord; it
is to be forced upon none. Hence we learn from holy tradition
that it has been the invariable practice to administer Baptism to
no individual without previously asking him if he be willing to
receive it. This disposition even infants are presumed to have,
since the will of the Church, which promises for them, cannot be
mistaken. </p>

<p> Insane, delirious persons who were once of sound mind and
afterwards became deranged, having in their present state no wish
to be baptised, are not to be admitted to Baptism, unless in
danger of death. In such cases, if previous to insanity they give
intimation of a wish to be baptised, the Sacrament is to be
administered; without such indication previously given it is not
to be administered. The same rule is to be followed with regard
to persons who are unconscious.</p>

<p> But if they (the insane) never enjoyed the use of reason, the
authority and practice of the Church decide that they are to be
baptised in the faith of the Church, just as children are
baptised before they come to the use of reason.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Faith</h3>

<p>Besides a wish to be baptised, in order to obtain the grace of
the Sacrament, faith is also necessary. Our Lord and Saviour has
said: He that believes and is baptised shall be saved.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Repentance</h3>

<p>Another necessary condition is repentance for past sins, and a
fixed determination to avoid all sin in the future. Should anyone
desire Baptism and be unwilling to correct the habit of sinning,
he should be altogether rejected. For nothing is so opposed to
the grace and power of Baptism as the intention and purpose of
those who resolve never to abandon sin.</p>

<p> Seeing that Baptism should be sought with a view to put on
Christ and to be united to Him, it is manifest that he who
purposes to continue in sin should justly be repelled from the
sacred font, particularly since none of those things which belong
to Christ and His Church are to be received in vain, and since we
well understand that, as far as regards sanctifying and saving
grace, Baptism is received in vain by him who purposes to live
according to the flesh, and not according to the spirit. As far,
however, as the Sacrament is concerned, if the person who is
rightly baptised intends to receive what the Church administers,
he without doubt validly receives the Sacrament.</p>

<p> Hence, to the vast multitude who, in compunction of heart, as
the Scripture says, asked him and the other Apostles what they
should do, the Prince of the Apostles answered: Do penance and be
baptised every one of you; and in another place he said: Be
penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out. Writing to the Romans, St. Paul also clearly shows
that he who is baptised should entirely die to sin; and he
therefore admonishes us not to yield our members as instruments
of iniquity unto sin, but present ourselves to God, as those who
are alive from the dead.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Advantages To Be Derived From These Reflections </h3>

<p>Frequent reflection upon these truths cannot fail, in the
first place, to fill the minds of the faithful with admiration
for the infinite goodness of God, who, uninfluenced by any other
consideration than that of His mercy, gratuitously bestowed upon
us, undeserving as we are, a blessing so extraordinary and divine
as that of Baptism. </p>

<p> If in the next place they consider how spotless should be the
lives of those who have been made the objects of such
munificence, they cannot fail to be convinced of the special
obligation imposed on every Christian to spend each day of his
life in such sanctity and fervour, as if on that very day he had
received the Sacrament and grace of Baptism.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Effects of Baptism</h3>

<p>To inflame the minds of the faithful, however, with a zeal for
true piety, pastors will find no means more efficacious than an
accurate exposition of the effects of Baptism.</p>

<p> The effects of Baptism should be frequently explained, in
order that the faithful may be rendered more sensible of the high
dignity to which they have been raised, and may never suffer
themselves to be cast down therefrom by the snares or assaults of
Satan. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Effect Of Baptism: Remission Of Sin</h3>

<p>They are to be taught, in the first place, that such is the
admirable efficacy of this Sacrament that it remits original sin
and actual guilt, however unthinkable its enormity may seem. </p>

<p> This was foretold long before by Ezechiel, through whom God
said: I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed
from all your filthiness. The Apostle also, writing to the
Corinthians, after having enumerated a long catalogue of sins,
adds: such you were, but you are washed, but you are sanctified. </p>

<p> That such was at all times the doctrine handed down by holy
Church is clear. By the generation of the flesh, says St.
Augustine in his book On the Baptism of Infants, we contract
original sin only; by the regeneration of the Spirit, we obtain
forgiveness not only of original, but also of actual sins. St.
Jerome also, writing to Oceanus, says: all sins are forgiven in
Baptism.</p>

<p> To remove all further doubt on the subject, the Council of
Trent, after other Councils had defined this, declared it anew,
pronouncing anathema against those who should presume to think
otherwise, or should dare to assert that although sin is forgiven
in Baptism, it is not entirely removed or totally eradicated, but
is cut away in such a manner as to leave its roots still fixed in
the soul. To use the words of the same holy Council, God hates
nothing in those who are regenerated; for there remains nothing
deserving of condemnation in those who are truly buried with
Christ by Baptism unto death, &quot;who walk not according to the
flesh&quot; but putting off the old man, and putting on the new,
who is created according to God, become innocent, spotless, pure,
upright, and beloved of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Concupiscence Which Remains After Baptism Is No Sin</h6>

<p> We must confess, however, that concupiscence, or the fuel of
sin, still remains, as the Council declares in the same place.
But concupiscence does not constitute sin, for, as St. Augustine
observes, in children who have been baptised the guilt of
concupiscence is removed, (the concupiscence itself) remains for
probation; and in another place he says: the guilt of
concupiscence is pardoned in Baptism, but its infirmity remains.
For concupiscence which is the effect of sin is nothing more than
an appetite of the soul in itself repugnant to reason. But if it
is not accompanied by the consent of the will or by negligence,
it is very far from being sin.</p>

<p> When St. Paul says, I did not know concupiscence, if the law
did not say: Thou shalt not covet, he speaks not of concupiscence
itself, but of the fault of the will.</p>

<p> The same doctrine is taught by St. Gregory when he says: If
there are any who assert that in Baptism sin is but superficially
effaced, what could be more untrue than their statement? By the
Sacrament of faith the soul, entirely freed from sin, adheres to
God alone. In proof of this doctrine he has recourse to the
testimony of our Saviour who says in St. John: He that is
­washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Further Proof Of The First Effect Of Baptism </h6>

<p> Should anyone desire a striking figure and image (of the
efficacy of Baptism) let him consider the history of Naaman the
Syrian leper, of whom the Scriptures inform us that when he had
washed seven times in the waters of the Jordan he was so cleansed
from his leprosy that his flesh became like the flesh of a child.
</p>

<p> The remission of all sin, original and actual, is therefore
the peculiar effect of Baptism. That this was the object of its
institution by our Lord and Saviour is clearly stated by the
Prince of the Apostles, to say nothing of other testimonies, when
he says: Do penance and be baptised every one of you, in the name
of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Second Effect Of Baptism: Remission Of All
Punishment Due To Sin</h3>

<p>In Baptism not only is sin forgiven, but with it all the
punishment due to sin is mercifully remitted by God. To
communicate the efficacy of the Passion of Christ our Lord is an
effect common to all the Sacraments; but of Baptism alone does
the Apostle say, that by it we die and are buried together with
Christ.</p>

<p> Hence holy Church has always understood that to impose those
works of piety, usually called by the holy Fathers works of
satisfaction, on one who is to be cleansed in Baptism, would be
injurious to this Sacrament in the highest degree.</p>

<p> Nor is there any discrepancy between the doctrine here taught
and the practice of the primitive Church, which of old commanded
the Jews, when preparing for Baptism, to observe a fast of forty
successive days. (The fast thus imposed) was not enjoined as a
work of satisfaction; but those who had received Baptism were
thus admonished to devote some time to the uninterrupted exercise
of fasting and prayer in honour of so great a Sacrament. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Baptism Does Not Exempt From Penalties Of The Civil Law</h6>

<p> Although the remission by Baptism of the punishments due to
sin cannot be questioned, we are not to infer that it exempts an
offender from the punishments decreed by civil tribunals for some
grave crime. Thus a person sentenced to death is not rescued by
Baptism from the penalty ordained by the law.</p>

<p> We cannot, however, too highly commend the religion and piety
of those rulers who remit the sentence of the law, that the glory
of God may be the more strikingly displayed in His Sacraments. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Baptism Remits The Punishment Due To Original Sin After Death
</h6>

<p> Baptism also remits all the punishment due to original sin
after this life, for through the merit of the death of our Lord
we are able to attain this blessing. By Baptism, as we have
already said, we die with Christ. For if, says the Apostle, we
have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall
be also in the likeness of his resurrection.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Baptism Does Not Free Us From The Miseries Of Life</h6>

<p> Should it be asked why immediately after Baptism we are not
exempt in this mortal life from misfortunes and restored by the
influence of this sacred ablution to that state of perfection in
which Adam, the father of the human race, was placed before his
fall, the answer will be that there are two chief reasons for
this.</p>

<p> In the first place we who by Baptism are united to, and
become members of Christ's body, should not be more honoured than
our Head. Now Christ our Lord, although clothed from His birth
with the plenitude of grace and truth, was not divested of human
infirmity which He assumed, until, having suffered and died, He
rose to the glory of immortality. It cannot appear extraordinary,
therefore, if the faithful, even after they have received the
grace of justification by Baptism, are clothed with frail and
perishable bodies until, having undergone many labours for the
sake of Christ, and having closed their earthly career, they are
recalled to life and found worthy to enjoy with Him an eternity
of bliss.</p>

<p> The second reason why bodily infirmity, disease, sense of
pain and motions of concupiscence remain after Baptism is that in
them we may have the seed and material of virtue from which we
shall hereafter receive a more abundant harvest of glory and more
ample rewards. When, with patient resignation, we bear all the
trials of life, and, aided by the divine assistance, subject to
the dominion of reason the rebellious desires of the heart, we
ought to cherish an assured hope that if, with the Apostle we
shall have fought a good fight, finished the course, and kept the
faith, the Lord, the just judge, will render to us on that day a
crown of justice which is laid up for us.</p>

<p> Such seems to have been the divine plan with regard to the
children of Israel. God delivered them from the bondage of Egypt,
having drowned Pharaoh and his hosts in the sea; yet He did not
conduct them immediately into the happy land of promise; He first
tried them by a variety and multiplicity of sufferings. And when
He afterwards placed them in possession of the promised land and
expelled the previous inhabitants from their native territories,
yet He left a few other nations whom the Israelites could not
exterminate, in order that His people might always have occasion
to exercise fortitude and warlike courage.</p>

<p> We may add that if, to the heavenly gifts with which the soul
is adorned in Baptism, were joined temporal advantages, there
would be good reason to doubt whether many might not approach
Baptism with a view to obtain such advantages in this life,
rather than the glory to be hoped for in the next; whereas the
Christian should always propose to himself, not these delusive
and uncertain goods which are seen, but the solid and eternal
ones which are not seen.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Baptism A Source Of Happiness To The Christian Even In This
Life</h6>

<p> This life, however, although full of misery, does not lack
its pleasures and joys. To us, who by Baptism are engrafted as
branches on Christ's what could be more pleasing or desirable
than, taking up the cross upon our shoulders, to follow Him as
our leader, fatigued by no labor, retarded by no danger, in
ardent pursuit of the rewards of our high vocation; some to
receive the laurel of virginity, others the crown of teaching and
preaching, some the palm of martyrdom, others the honours
appropriate to their respective virtues? These splendid titles of
exalted dignity none of us should receive, had we not contended
in the race of this calamitous life and stood unconquered in the
conflict.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Third Effect Of Baptism: Grace Of Regeneration </h3>

<p>But to return to the effects of Baptism, it should be taught
that by virtue of this Sacrament we are not only delivered from
what are justly deemed the greatest of all evils, but are also
enriched with invaluable goods and blessings. Our souls are
replenished with divine grace, by which we are rendered just and
children of God and are made heirs to eternal salvation. For it
is written: He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved,
and the Apostle testifies that the Church is cleansed by the
laver of water in the word of life. Now according to the
definition of the Council of Trent, which under pain of anathema
we are bound to believe, grace not only remits sin, but is also a
divine quality inherent in the soul, and, as it were, a brilliant
light that effaces all those stains which obscure the lustre of
the soul, investing it with increased brightness and beauty. This
is also a clear inference from the words of Scripture when it
says that grace is poured forth, and also when it usually calls
grace, the pledge of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fourth Effect Of Baptism: Infused Virtues And
Incorporation With Christ</h3>

<p>This grace is accompanied by a most splendid train of all
virtues, which are divinely infused into the soul along with
grace. Hence, when writing to Titus, the Apostle says: He saved
us by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost,
whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus
Christ our Saviour. St. Augustine, in explanation of the words,
poured forth abundantly, says: that is, for the remission of sins
and for abundance of virtues.</p>

<p> By Baptism we are also united to Christ, as members to their
Head. As therefore from the head proceeds the power by which the
different members of the body are moved to the proper performance
of their respective functions, so from the fullness of Christ the
Lord are diffused divine grace and virtue through all those who
are justified, qualifying them for the performance of all the
duties of Christian piety.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Why The Practice Of Virtue Is Difficult Even After Baptism </h6>

<p> Though we are thus supported by a powerful array of virtues,
it should not excite our surprise if we cannot, without much
labor and difficulty, undertake, or at least, perform acts of
piety and of moral virtue. If this is so, it is not because the
goodness of God has not bestowed on us the virtues from which
these good works proceed; but because there still remains after
Baptism a severe conflict of the flesh against the spirit, in
which, however, it would not become a Christian to be dispirited
or grow faint. </p>

<p> Relying on the divine goodness we should confidently hope
that by a constant habit of leading a holy life the time will
come when whatever things are modest, whatever just, whatever
holy, will also prove easy and agreeable. Let these be the
subjects of our willing consideration, the objects of our
cheerful practice, that the God of peace may be with us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Fifth Effect Of Baptism: Character Of Christian </h3>

<p>By Baptism, moreover, we are sealed with a character that can
never be effaced from the soul. On this point, however, we need
not speak at length, for what we have already sufficiently said
on the subject, when treating of the Sacraments in general, may
be applied here.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Baptism Not To Be Repeated</h3>

<p>Since on account of the nature and efficacy of this character
it has been defined by the Church that this Sacrament is on no
account to be reiterated, pastors should frequently and
diligently admonish the faithful on this subject, lest at any
time they may be led into error.</p>

<p> This doctrine is taught by the Apostle when he says: One
Lord, one faith, one baptism. Again, when exhorting the Romans,
that being dead in Christ by Baptism they should take care not to
lose the life which they had received from Him, he says: In that
Christ died unto sin, he died once. These words seem clearly to
signify that as Christ cannot die again, neither can we die again
by Baptism. Hence the holy Church also openly professes that she
believes one Baptism. That this agrees with the nature of the
thing and with reason is understood from the very idea of
Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration. As then, by virtue of
the laws of nature, we are generated and born but once, and, as
St. Augustine observes, there is no returning to the womb; so, in
like manner, there is but one spiritual generation, and Baptism
is never at any time to be repeated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>In Conditional Baptism The Sacrament Is Not Repeated </h6>

<p> Nor let anyone suppose that it is repeated by the Church when
she baptises anyone whose previous Baptism was doubtful, making
use of this formula: If thou art baptised, I baptise thee not
again but if thou art not yet baptised, I baptise thee in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. In
such cases Baptism is not to be considered as impiously repeated,
but as holily, yet conditionally, administered.</p>

<p> In this connection, however, there are some matters, in
which, to the very great injury of the Sacrament, abuses are of
almost daily occurrence, and which therefore demand the diligent
attention of pastors. For there are not wanting those who think
that no sin is committed if they indiscriminately administer
conditional Baptism. Hence if an infant be brought to them, they
think that no inquiry need be made as to whether it was
previously baptised, but proceed immediately to baptise the
child. Nay more, although they be well aware that the Sacrament
was administered at home, they do not hesitate to repeat its
administration in the Church conditionally, making use of the
solemn ceremonies of the Church. </p>

<p> This certainly they cannot do without sacrilege and without
incurring what theologians call an irregularity. According to the
authority of Pope Alexander the conditional form of Baptism is to
be used only when after due inquiry doubts are entertained as to
the validity of the previous Baptism. In no other case is it ever
lawful to administer Baptism a second time, even conditionally. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Sixth Effect Of Baptism: Opening The Gates Of Heaven</h3>

<p>Besides the other advantages which accrue to us from Baptism,
the last, to which all the others seem to be referred, is that it
opens to us the portals of heaven which sin had closed against
us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Effects Of Baptism Foreshadowed In The Baptism Of
Christ</h3>

<p>These effects which are wrought in us by virtue of Baptism are
distinctly marked by the circumstances which, as the Gospel
relates, accompanied the Baptism of our Saviour. The heavens were
opened and the Holy Ghost appeared descending upon Christ our
Lord in the form of a dove. By this we are given to understand
that to those who are baptised are imparted the gifts of the Holy
Spirit, that to them are opened the gates of heaven. The
baptised, it is true, do not enter heaven immediately after
Baptism, but in due season. When they shall have been freed from
all misery which is incompatible with a state of bliss, they
shall exchange a mortal for an immortal life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Measure In Which Those Effects Are Obtained</h3>

<p>These are the fruits of Baptism, which, if we consider the
efficacy of the Sacrament, are, no doubt, equally common to all;
but if we consider the dispositions with which it is received, it
is no less certain that all do not share to the same extent in
these heavenly gifts and graces.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ceremonies of Baptism</h3>

<h3>Their Importance</h3>

<p>It now remains to explain, clearly and concisely, what is to
be taught concerning the prayers, rites, and ceremonies of this
Sacrament. To rites and ceremonies may, in some measure, be
applied what the Apostle says of the gift of tongues, that it is
unprofitable to speak, unless the faithful understand. They
present an image, and convey the signification of the things that
are done in the Sacrament; but if the people do not understand
the force and meaning of these signs, there is but little
advantage derived from ceremonies. Pastors should take care,
therefore, to make them understood and to impress the minds of
the faithful with a conviction that, although ceremonies are not
of absolute necessity, they are of very great importance and
deserve great veneration.</p>

<p> This the authority of those by whom they were instituted, who
were, no doubt, the Apostles, and also the object of their
institution, sufficiently prove. It is manifest that ceremonies
contribute to the more religious and holy administration of the
Sacraments, serve to place, as it were, before the eyes the
exalted and inestimable gifts which they contain, and impress on
the minds of the faithful a deeper sense of the boundless
beneficence of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Three Classes Of Ceremonies In Baptism</h3>

<p>In order that the pastor's instructions may follow a certain
plan and that the people may find it: easier to remember his
words, all the ceremonies and prayers which the Church uses in
the administration of Baptism are to be reduced to three heads.
The first comprehends such as are observed before coming to the
baptismal font; the second, such as are used at the font; the
third, those that usually follow the administration of the
Sacrament. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ceremonies That Are Observed Before Coming To The
Font: Consecration Of Baptismal Water</h3>

<p>In the first place, then, the water to be used in Baptism
should be prepared. The baptismal font is consecrated with the
oil of mystic unction; not, however, at all times, but, according
to ancient usage, only on certain feasts, which are justly deemed
the greatest and the most holy solemnities in the year. The water
of Baptism was consecrated on the vigils of those feasts; and on
those days alone, except in cases of necessity, it was also the
practice of the ancient Church to administer Baptism. But
although the Church, on account of the dangers to which life is
continually exposed, has deemed it expedient to change her
discipline in this respect, she still observes with the greatest
solemnity the festivals of Easter and Pentecost on which the
baptismal water is to be consecrated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Person To Be Baptised Stands At The Church Door</h6>

<p> After the consecration of the water the other ceremonies that
precede Baptism are next to be explained. The persons to be
baptised are brought or conducted a to the door of the church and
are strictly forbidden to enter, as unworthy to be admitted into
the house of God, until they have cast off the yoke of the most
degrading servitude and devoted themselves unreservedly to Christ
the Lord and His most just authority.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>Catechetical Instruction</h6>

<p> The priest then asks what they demand of the Church; and
having received the answer, he first instructs them in the
doctrines of the Christian faith, of which a profession is to be
made in Baptism.</p>

<p> This the priest does in a brief catechetical instruction, a
practice which originated, no doubt, in the precept of our Lord
addressed to His Apostles: Go ye into the whole world, and teach
all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you. From this command we may learn
that Baptism is not to be administered until, at least, the
principal truths of our religion are explained.</p>

<p> But as the catechetical form consists of many interrogations,
if the person to be instructed be an adult, he himself answers;
if an infant, the sponsor answers for him according to the
prescribed form and makes the solemn promise.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Exorcism</h6>

<p> The exorcism comes next in order. It consists of words of
sacred and religious import and of prayers, and is used to expel
the devil, to weaken and crush his power.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Salt</h6>

<p> To the exorcism are added other ceremonies, each of which,
being mystical, has its own clear signification. When, for
instance, salt is put into the mouth of the person to be
baptised, this evidently means that, by the doctrines of faith
and by the gift of grace, he shall be delivered from the
corruption of sin, shall experience a relish for good works, and
shall be delighted with the food of divine wisdom. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Sign Of The Cross </h6>

<p> Next his forehead, eyes, breast, shoulders and ears are
signed with the sign of the cross, to declare, that by the
mystery of Baptism, the senses of the person baptised are opened
and strengthened, to enable him to receive God, and to understand
and observe His Commandments.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Saliva</h6>

<p> His nostrils and ears are next touched with spittle, and he
is then immediately admitted to the baptismal font. By this
ceremony we understand that, as sight was given to the blind man
mentioned in the Gospel, whom the Lord after He had spread clay
on his eyes commanded to wash them in the waters of Siloe, so
through the efficacy of holy Baptism a light is let in on the
mind, which enables it to discern heavenly truth.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ceremonies Observed After Coming To The Font </h3>

<p>After the performance of these ceremonies the persons to be
baptised approach the baptismal font, at which are performed
other rites and ceremonies which present a summary of the
Christian religion. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Renunciation Of Satan</h6>

<p> Three distinct times the person to be baptised is asked by
the priest: Dost thou renounce Satan, and all his works, and all
his pomps? To each of which he, or the sponsor in his name,
replies, I renounce. Whoever, then, purposes to enlist, under the
standard of Christ, must first of all, enter into a sacred and
solemn engagement to renounce the devil and the world, and always
to hold them in utter detestation as his worst enemies. </p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Profession Of Faith</h6>

<p> Next, standing at the baptismal font, he is interrogated by
the priest in these words: Dost thou believe in God, the Father
Almighty? To which he answers: I believe. Being similarly
questioned on the remaining Articles of the Creed, he solemnly
professes his faith. These two promises contain, it is clear, the
sum and substance of the law of Christ.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Wish To Be Baptised</h6>

<p> When the Sacrament is now about to be administered, the
priest asks the candidate if he wishes to be baptised. After an
answer in the affirmative has been given by him, or, if he is an
infant, by the sponsor, the priest immediately performs the
salutary ablution, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. </p>

<p> As man, by yielding the assent of his will to the wicked
suggestions of Satan, fell under a just sentence of condemnation;
so God will have none enrolled in the number of His soldiers but
those whose service is voluntary, that by a willing obedience to
His commands they may obtain eternal salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ceremonies That Follow Baptism: Chrism</h3>

<p>After the person has been baptised, the priest anoints the
crown of his head with chrism, thus giving him to understand,
that from that day he is united as a member to Christ, His Head,
and ingrafted on His body; and that he is, therefore, called a
Christian from Christ, as Christ is so called from chrism. What
the chrism signifies, the prayers then offered by the priest, as
St. Ambrose observes, sufficiently explain.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The White Garment</h6>

<p> On the person baptised the priest then puts a white garment
saying: Receive this white garment, which mayest thou carry
unstained before the judgment­seat of our Lord Jesus Christ;
that thou mayest have eternal life. Instead of a white garment,
infants, because not formally dressed, receive a white cloth,
accompanied by the same words.</p>

<p> According to the teaching of the Fathers this symbol
signifies the glory of the resurrection to which we are born by
Baptism, the brightness and beauty with which the soul, when
purified from the stains of sin, is invested in Baptism, and the
innocence and integrity which the person who has received Baptism
should preserve throughout life.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Lighted Candle</h6>

<p> A lighted taper is then put into the hand of the baptised to
signify that faith, inflamed by charity, which is received in
Baptism, is to be fed and augmented by the exercise of good
works.</p>

<p> </p>

<h6>The Name Given In Baptism</h6>

<p> Finally, a name is given the person baptised. It should be
taken from some person whose eminent sanctity has given him a
place in the catalogue of the Saints. The similarity of name will
stimulate each one to imitate the virtues and holiness of the
Saint, and, moreover, to hope and pray that he who is the model
for his imitation will also be his advocate and watch over the
safety of his body and soul.</p>

<p> Wherefore those are to be reproved who search for the names
of heathens, especially of those who were the greatest monsters
of iniquity, to bestow upon their children. By such conduct they
practically prove how little they regard Christian piety when
they so fondly cherish the memory of impious men, as to wish to
have their profane names continually echo in the ears of the
faithful. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Recapitulation</h3>

<p>This exposition of the Sacrament of Baptism, if given by
pastors, will be found to embrace almost everything which should
be known regarding this Sacrament. We have explained the meaning
of the word Baptism, the nature and substance of the Sacrament,
and also the parts of which it is composed. We have said by whom
it was instituted; who are the ministers necessary to its
administration; who should be, as it were, the tutors whose
instructions should sustain the weakness of the person baptised;
to whom Baptism should be administered; and how they should be
disposed; what are the virtue and efficacy of the Sacrament;
finally, we have developed, at sufficient length for our purpose,
the rites and ceremonies that should accompany its
administration.</p>

<p> Pastors should recollect that the chief purpose of all these
instructions is to induce the faithful to direct their constant
attention and solicitude to the fulfilment of the promises so
sacredly made at Baptism, and to lead lives not unworthy of the
sanctity that should accompany the name and profession of
Christian.</p>
