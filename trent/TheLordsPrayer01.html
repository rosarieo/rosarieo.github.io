<h3><center>THE FIRST PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER:
&quot;<i>HALLOWED BE THY NAME</i></center>&quot;</h3>

<h3>Why This Petition Is Placed First</h3>

<p>What we are to ask of God and in what order, the Master and
Lord of all has Himself taught and commanded. For prayer is the
ambassador and interpreter of our thoughts and desires; and
consequently we pray well and properly when the order of our
petitions follows the order in which the things sought are
desirable. </p>

<p> Now, genuine charity tells us to direct our whole soul and
all our affections to God, for He alone being the one supreme
Good, it is but reasonable that we love Him with superior and
singular love. On the other hand, God cannot be loved from the
heart and above all things else, unless we prefer His honour and
glory to all things created. For all the good that we or others
possess, all that in any way bears the name of good, comes from
Him, and is therefore inferior to Him, the sovereign Good.</p>

<p> Hence, that our prayers may be made with due order, our
Saviour has placed this Petition regarding the sovereign Good at
the head of all the other Petitions of the Lord's Prayer, thus
showing us that before asking the things necessary for ourselves
or for others, we ought to ask those that appertain to God's
honour, and to manifest and make known to Him the affections and
desires of our hearts in this regard. Acting thus, we shall be
faithful to the claims and rules of charity, which teaches us to
love God more than ourselves and to ask, in the first place,
those things we desire on His account, and next, those things we
desire on our own.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Object Of The First Three Petitions</h3>

<p>But as our desires and petitions concern such things only as
are needed, and as nothing can be added to God; that is to say.
to the Divine Nature, nor can His Divine Substance, which is
ineffably rich in all perfection, be in any way increased, we
must remember that the things we ask of God on God's own account
are extrinsic and concern His exterior glory.</p>

<p> Thus we desire and beg that His name may be more and better
known in the world, that His kingdom may be extended, and that
each day new servants may come to obey His holy will. These three
things, His name, His kingdom, and obedience (to His will), do
not appertain to the intrinsic nature and perfection of God, but
are extrinsic thereto.</p>

<p> To enable the faithful to understand still more clearly the
force and bearing of these Petitions, the pastor should take care
to point out to them that the words, On earth as it is in heaven,
may be understood of each of the first three Petitions, as
follows: Hallowed be thy name on earth as it is in heaven; Thy
kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven; and, Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Hallowed Be Thy Name</h3>

<p>In praying that the name of God may be hallowed, our meaning
is that the sanctity and glory of the divine name may be
increased. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>On Earth As It Is In Heaven&quot;</h3>

<p>But in this connection the pastor should observe and should
point out to his pious hearers that our Saviour does not in this
expression say that the name of God is to be sanctified on earth
in the same manner as it is in heaven; that is, that its earthly
sanctification is to be equal in magnificence to its heavenly, a
thing which is absolutely impossible, but only that such
sanctification proceed from love and from the inmost affections
of the soul. True, indeed, the divine name has in itself no need
to be sanctified, since it is terrible and ­holy,' as God
Himself in His very Nature is holy, nor can any holiness be
attributed Him which He has not possessed from all eternity; yet
seeing that here below an honour far inferior to that which He
deserves is rendered to Him, and that sometimes even He is
dishonoured by cursing and blasphemy, we therefore desire and beg
that His name may be exalted here on earth with praise, honour,
and glory, after the example of that praise, honour and glory
which are given Him in heaven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What Sanctification of God's Name we should Pray For</h3>

<h3>That The Faithful May Glorify Him</h3>

<p>In other words we pray that our minds, our souls and our lips
may be so devoted to the honour and worship of God as to glorify
Him. with all veneration both interior and exterior, and, after
the model of the heavenly citizens, to celebrate with all our
might the greatness, the glory and the holiness of the name of
God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>That Unbelievers May Be Converted</h3>

<p>Thus, then, as the heavenly spirits with perfect unanimity
exalt and glorify God, so do we pray that the same be done over
all the earth; that all nations may come to know, worship, and
reverence God; that all without a single exception may embrace
the Christian religion, may devote themselves wholly to the
service of God, and may be convinced that in Him is the source of
all sanctity and that there is nothing pure, nothing holy, that
does not proceed from the sanctity of His divine name. According
to the testimony of the Apostle, The church is cleansed by the
laver of water in the word of life. and the word of life
signifies the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost in which we are baptised and sanctified.</p>

<p> And since there is no expiation, no purity, no integrity, in
him over whom the divine name has not been invoked, we desire and
pray that all mankind may abandon the darkness of their impious
infidelity, and, enlightened by the rays of divine light, may
come to recognise the power of this name and look to it alone for
true sanctity, and that thus receiving the Sacrament of Baptism
in the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, they may receive
the plenitude of sanctity from the right hand of God Himself. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>That Sinners May Be Converted</h3>

<p>Moreover, our desires and our supplications extend equally to
those, who, stained with sin and wickedness, have lost the purity
of their Baptism and their robe of innocence, thus permitting the
unclean spirit to take up his abode once more in their unhappy
souls. We therefore desire and pray God that in these also His
name may be sanctified; that they may reenter into themselves
and, returning to a right frame of mind, may recover their former
holiness through the Sacrament of Penance, and become once more
the pure and holy temple and dwelling­place of God.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>That God May Be Thanked For His Favours</h3>

<p>Finally, we pray that God may make His light to shine on the
minds of all, so as to enable them to see that every best gift
and e very perfect gift coming from the Father of lights, is
conferred on us by Him, and consequently that temperance,
justice, life, health, in a word, all goods of soul, body and
possessions, all goods both natural and supernatural, must be
recognised as gifts given by Him from whom, as the Church
proclaims, proceed all blessings. If the sun by its light, if the
stars by their motion and revolutions, are of any advantage to
man; if the air with which we are surrounded serves to sustain
us; if the earth with its abundance of produce and its fruits
furnishes the means of subsistence to all men; if our rulers by
their vigilance enable us to enjoy peace and tranquillity, it is
to the infinite goodness of God that we owe these and innumerable
blessings of a similar kind,­nay, those very causes which
philosophers call secondary, we should regard as so many hands of
God, wonderfully fashioned and fitted for our use, by means of
which He distributes His blessings and diffuses them everywhere
in profusion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>That The Church May Be Recognised By All</h3>

<p>But what we most particularly ask in this Petition is that all
may acknowledge and revere the spouse of Jesus Christ, our most
holy mother the Church, in which alone is to be found the copious
and inexhaustible fountain that cleanses and effaces all the
stains of sin, and from which are drawn all the Sacraments of
salvation and sanctification, those Sacraments through which,
like so many sacred channels, is diffused over us by the hand of
God the dew, of sanctity. To that Church alone and to those whom
she embraces in her bosom and holds in her arms, appertains the
invocation of that divine name, outside of which there is no
other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What Sanctification Of God's Name We Should Practice </h3>

<p>The pastor should be careful to insist particularly on the
fact that it is the duty of a good son not only to pray to God
his Father in words, but also to endeavour by his conduct and
actions to promote the sanctification of the divine name. And
would to God there were none who, though continually praying for
the sanctification of God's name, yet, as far as in them lies,
violate and profane it by their deeds, and by whose fault God
Himself is sometimes blasphemed. It was of such as these that the
Apostle said: The name of God through you is blasphemed among the
Gentiles; and in Ezechiel we read: They entered among the nations
whither they went, and profaned my holy name, when it was said of
them: &quot;This is the people of the Lord, and they are come
forth out of his land&quot;; for according to the sort of life
and conduct led by those professing a particular religion, so
precisely in the eyes of the unlettered multitude will be the
opinion held of that religion and of its author.</p>

<p> Those, therefore, who live according to the dictates of the
Christian religion which they have embraced, and who regulate
their prayers and actions by its precepts, furnish others with a
powerful motive for greatly praising, honouring and glorifying
the name of our heavenly Father. As for us, it is a duty which
the Lord has imposed on us, to lead others by shining deeds of
virtue to praise and glorify the name of God. This is how He
addresses us in the Gospel: Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is
in heaven; and the Prince of the Apostles says: Having your
conversation good among the Gentiles, that they may, by the good
works which they shall behold in you, glorify God.</p>
