<h3><center>THE SEVENTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER:
&quot; <i>BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL</i>&quot;</center></h3>

<h3>The Importance Of Instruction On This Petition </h3>

<p>This Petition with which the Son of God concludes this divine
prayer embodies the substance of all the other Petitions. To show
its force and importance our Lord made use of this Petition when,
on the eve of His Passion, He prayed to God His Father for the
salvation of mankind. I pray, He said, that thou keep them from
evil. In this Petition, then, which He not only commanded us to
use, but made use of Himself, He has epitomised, as it were, the
meaning and spirit of all the other Petitions. For if we obtain
what this Petition asks, that is, the protection of God against
evil, which enables us to stand secure and safe against the
machinations of the world and the devil, then, as St. Cyprian
remarks, nothing more remains to be asked.</p>

<p> Such, then, being the importance of this Petition, the
diligence of the pastor in its exposition should be great. The
difference between this and the preceding Petition consists in
this, that in the one we beg to avoid sin, in the other, to
escape punishment. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Necessity Of This Petition</h3>

<p>It cannot be necessary to remind the faithful of the numerous
evils and calamities to which we are exposed, and how much we
stand in need of the divine assistance. The many and serious
miseries of human life have been fully described by sacred and
profane writers, and there is hardly any one who has not observed
them either in his own life or in that of others.</p>

<p> We are all convinced of the truth of these words of Job, that
model of patience: Man, born of woman, and living for a short
time, is filled with many miseries. He cometh forth like a
flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never
continueth in the same state. That no day passes without its own
trouble or annoyance is proved by these words of Christ the Lord:
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Indeed, the condition
of human life is pointed out by the Lord Himself, when He
admonishes us that we are to take up our cross daily and follow
Him.</p>

<p> Since, therefore, everyone must realise the trials and
dangers inseparable from this life, it will not be difficult to
convince the faithful that they ought to implore of God
deliverance from evil, since no inducement to prayer exercises a
more powerful influence over men than a desire and hope of
deliverance from those evils which oppress or threaten them.
There is in the heart of everyone a natural inclination to have
instant recourse to God in the face of danger, as it is written:
Fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek thy name, Lord.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How this Petition should be Made</h3>

<p>If, then, in calamities and dangers the unbidden impulse of
nature prompts men to call on God, it surely becomes the duty of
those to whose fidelity and prudence their salvation is entrusted
to instruct them carefully in the proper performance of this
duty. </p>

<p> WE SHOULD SEEK FIRST THE GLORY OF GOD</p>

<p> For there are some who, contrary to the command of Christ,
reverse the order of this prayer. He who commands us to have
recourse to Him in the day of tribulation, has also prescribed to
us the order in which we should pray. It is His will that, before
we pray to be delivered from evil, we ask that the name of God be
sanctified, that His kingdom come, and so on through the other
Petitions, which are, as it were, so many steps by which we reach
this last Petition.</p>

<p> Yet there are those who, if their head, their side, or their
foot, ache; if they suffer loss of property; if menaces or
dangers from an enemy alarm them; if famine, war or pestilence
afflict them, omit all the other Petitions of the Lord's Prayer
and ask only to be delivered from these evils. This practice is
at variance with the command of Christ the Lord: Seek first the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p> To pray, therefore, as we ought, we should have in view the
greater glory of God, even when we ask deliverance from
calamities, trials and dangers. Thus, when David offered this
prayer: Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, he subjoined a reason
by which he showed that he was most desirous of God's glory,
saying: For there is no one in death that is mindful of thee, and
who shall confess to thee in hell. And again, having implored God
to have mercy on him, he added: I will teach the unjust thy ways;
and the wicked shall be converted to thee.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Our Chief Hope Of Deliverance Should Be In God </h3>

<p>The faithful should be encouraged to use this salutary manner
of praying and to imitate the example of the Prophet. And at the
same time their attention should be called to the marked
difference that exists between the prayers of the infidel and
those of the Christian.</p>

<p> The infidel, too, begs of God to cure his diseases and to
heal his wounds, to deliver him from approaching or impending
evils; but he places his principal hope of deliverance in the
remedies provided by nature, or prepared by man. He makes no
scruple of using medicine no matter by whom prepared, no matter
if accompanied by charms, spells or other diabolical arts,
provided he can promise himself some hope of recovery.</p>

<p> Not so the Christian. When visited by sickness, or other
adversity, he flies to God as his supreme refuge and defence.
Acknowledging and revering God alone as the author of all his
good and his deliverer he ascribes to Him whatever healing virtue
resides in medicines, convinced that they help the sick only in
so far as God wills it. For it is God who has given medicines to
man to heal his corporal infirmities; and hence these words of
Ecclesiasticus: The most High hath created medicines out of the
earth, and a wise man will not abhor them. He, therefore, who has
pledged his fidelity to Jesus Christ, does not place his
principal hope of recovery in such remedies; he places it in God,
the author of these medicines. </p>

<p> Hence the Sacred Scriptures condemn the conduct of those who,
confiding in the power of medicine, seek no assistance from God.
Nay more, those who regulate their lives by the laws of God,
abstain from the use of all medicines which are not evidently
intended by God to be medicinal; and, were there even a certain
hope of recovery by using any other, they abstain from them as so
many charms and diabolical artifices.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>We Must Confidently Expect His Help</h3>

<p>The faithful, then, are to be exhorted to place their
confidence in God. Our most bountiful Father has commanded us to
beg of Him our deliverance from evil, in order that His command
should inspire us with the hope of obtaining the object of our
prayers. Of this truth the Sacred Scriptures afford many
illustrations, so that they whom reason does not inspire with
confidence may be persuaded to hope by a multitude of examples.
Abraham, Jacob, Lot, Joseph and David are to all unexceptional
witnesses of the divine goodness; and the instances recorded in
the New Testament of persons rescued from the greatest dangers,
by the efficacy of devout prayer, are so numerous as to make it
unnecessary to mention special cases. Therefore we shall content
ourselves with one text from the Prophet, which is sufficient to
confirm even the weakest: The just cried, and the Lord heard
them; and delivered them out of all their troubles. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;From Evil&quot;</h3>

<p>We now come to explain the meaning and nature of the Petition.
Let the faithful understand that in it we by no means ask
deliverance from every evil.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What We Do Not Pray For</h3>

<p>There are some things which are commonly considered evils, and
which, notwithstanding, are of advantage to those who endure
them. Such was the sting of the flesh to which the Apostle was
subjected in order that, by the aid of divine grace, power might
be perfected in infirmity. When the pious man learns the salutary
influence of such things, far from praying for their removal, he
rejoices in them exceedingly. We pray, therefore, against those
evils only, which do not conduce to our spiritual interests; not
against such as are profitable to our salvation. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What We Do Pray For</h3>

<p>The full meaning of this Petition, therefore, is, that having
been freed from sin and from the danger of temptation, we may be
delivered from internal and external evils; that we may be
protected from floods, fire and lightning; that the fruits of the
earth be not destroyed by hail; that we be not visited by famine,
sedition or war. We ask that God may banish disease, pestilence
and disaster from us; that He may keep us from slavery,
imprisonment, exile, betrayals, treachery, and from all other
evils which fill mankind with terror and misery. Finally, we pray
that God would remove all occasions of sin and iniquity. </p>

<p> We do not, however, pray to be delivered only from those
things which all look upon as evils, but also from those things
which almost all consider to be good, such as riches, honours,
health, strength and even life itself; that is, we ask that these
things be not detrimental or ruinous to our soul's welfare.</p>

<p> We also beg of God that we be not cut off by a sudden death;
that we provoke not His anger against us; that we be not
condemned to suffer the punishments reserved for the wicked; that
we be not sentenced to endure the fire of purgatory, from which
we piously and devoutly implore that others may be liberated. </p>

<p> This is the explanation of this Petition given by the Church
in the Mass and Litanies, where we pray to be delivered from evil
past, present and to come.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Deliver Us&quot;</h3>

<p>The goodness of God delivers us from evil in a variety of
ways. He prevents impending evils, as we read with regard to the
Patriarch Jacob, whom He delivered from the enemies that were
stirred up against him on account of the slaughter of the
Sichimites. For we read: The terror of God fell upon all the
cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they
went away. </p>

<p> The blessed who reign with Christ the Lord in heaven have
been delivered by the divine assistance from all evil; but, as
for us, although the Almighty delivers us from some evils, it is
not His will that, while journeying in this, our mortal
pilgrimage, we should be entirely exempt from all. The
consolations with which God sometimes refreshes those who labor
under adversity are, however, equivalent to an exemption from all
evil; and with these the Prophet consoled himself when he said:
According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy
consolations have rejoiced my soul.</p>

<p> God, moreover, delivers men from evil when he preserves them
unhurt in the midst of extreme danger, as He did in the case of
the children thrown into the fiery furnace, whom the fire did not
burn; and of Daniel, whom the lions did not injure.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Deliverance From Satan Especially Asked For</h3>

<p>According to the interpretation of St. Basil the Great, St.
Chrysostom and St. Augustine, the devil is specially called the
evil one, because he was the author of man's transgression, that
is, of his sin and iniquity, and also because God makes use of
him as an instrument to chastise sinful and impious men. For the
evils which mankind endures in punishment of sin are appointed by
God; and this is the meaning of these words of Holy Writ: Shall
there be evil in a city which the Lard hath not done? and: I am
the Lord and there is none else: I form the light and create
darkness: I make peace and create evil.</p>

<p> The devil is also called evil, because, although we have
never injured him, he wages perpetual war against us, and pursues
us with mortal hatred. If we put on the armour of faith and the
shield of innocence, he can have no power to hurt us;
nevertheless he unceasingly tempts us by external evils and every
other means of annoyance within his reach. Wherefore we beseech
God to deliver us from the evil one.</p>

<p> We say from evil, not from evils, because the evils which we
experience from others we ascribe to the arch enemy as their
author and instigator. Hence instead of cherishing resentment
against our neighbour, we should turn our hatred and anger
against Satan himself, by whom men are instigated to harm us.</p>

<p> Therefore if your neighbour has injured you in any respect,
when you pray to God your Father, beg of Him not only to deliver
you from evil, that is, from the injuries which your neighbour
inflicts; but also to rescue your neighbour from the power of the
devil, whose wicked suggestions impel men to wrong. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Patience and Joy under Continued Affliction</h3>

<p>Next we must remember that if by prayers and supplications we
are not delivered from evil, we should endure our afflictions
with patience, convinced that it is the will of God that we
should so endure them. If, therefore, God hear not our prayers,
we are not to yield to feelings of peevishness or discontent; we
must submit in all things to the divine will and pleasure,
regarding as useful and salutary to us that which happens in
accordance with the will of God, not that which is agreeable to
our own wishes. </p>

<p> Finally, the pious hearers should be admonished that during
our mortal career we should be prepared to meet every kind of
affliction and calamity, not only with patience, but even with
joy. For it is written: All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
shall suffer persecution; and again: Through many tribulations we
must enter into the kingdom of God; and further: Ought not Christ
to have suffered these things, and so enter into his glory? A
servant should not be greater than his master; and as St. Bernard
says: Delicate members do not become a head crowned with thorns.
The glorious example of Urias challenges our imitation. When
urged by David to remain at home, he replied: The ark of God, and
Israel, and Juda, dwell in tents; and shall I go into my house?</p>

<p> If to prayer we bring with us these reflections and these
dispositions, although surrounded by menaces and encompassed by
evils on every side, we shall, like the three children who passed
unhurt amidst the flames, be preserved uninjured; or at least,
like the Machabees, we shall bear up against adverse fortune with
firmness and fortitude. </p>

<p> In the midst of contumelies and tortures we should imitate
the blessed Apostles, who, after they had been scourged, rejoiced
exceedingly that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach
for Christ Jesus. Filled with such sentiments, we shall sing in
transports of joy: Princes have persecuted me without cause; and
my heart hath been in awe of thy words; I will rejoice at thy
words, as one that hath found great spoil.</p>
