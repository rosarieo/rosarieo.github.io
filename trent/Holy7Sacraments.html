<h2><center>PART II : THE SACRAMENTS</center></h2>

<h3>Importance Of Instruction On The Sacraments</h3>

<p>The exposition of every part of Christian doctrine demands
knowledge and industry on the part of the pastor. But instruction
on the Sacraments, which, by the ordinance of God, are a
necessary means of salvation and a plenteous source of spiritual
advantage, demands in a special manner his talents and industry
By accurate and frequent instruction (on the Sacraments) the
faithful will be enabled to approach worthily and with salutary
effect these inestimable and most holy institutions; and the
priests will not depart from the rule laid down in the divine
prohibition: Give not that which is holy to dogs: neither cast ye
your pearls before swine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Word &quot;Sacrament&quot;</h3>

<p>Since, then, we are about to treat of the Sacraments in
general, it is proper to begin in the first place by explaining
the force and meaning of the word Sacrament, and showing its
various significations, in order the more easily to comprehend
the sense in which it is here used. The faithful, therefore, are
to be informed that the word Sacrament, in so far as it concerns
our present purpose, is differently understood by sacred and
profane writers. </p>

<p> By some it has been used to express the obligation which
arises from an oath, pledging to the performance of some service;
and hence the oath by which soldiers promise military service to
the State has been called a military sacrament. Among profane
writers this seems to have been the most ordinary meaning of the
word. </p>

<p> But by the Latin Fathers who have written on theological
subjects, the word sacrament is used to signify a sacred thing
which lies concealed. The Greeks, to express the same idea, made
use of the word mystery. This we understand to be the meaning of
the word, when, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, it is said: That
he might make known to us the mystery (sacramentum) of his will;
and to Timothy: great is the mystery (sacramentum) of godliness;
and in the Book of Wisdom: They knew not the secrets (sacramenta)
of God. In these and many other passages the word sacrament,­ it
will be perceived, signifies nothing more than a holy thing that
lies concealed and hidden.</p>

<p> The Latin Doctors, therefore, deemed the word a very
appropriate term to express certain sensible signs which at once
communicate grace, declare it, and, as it were, place it before
the eyes. St. Gregory, however, is of the opinion that such a
sign is called a Sacrament, because the divine power secretly
operates our salvation under the veil of sensible things.</p>

<p> Let it not, however, be supposed that the word sacrament is
of recent ecclesiastical usage. Whoever peruses the works of
Saints Jerome and Augustine will at once perceive that ancient
ecclesiastical writers made use of the word sacrament, and some
times also of the word symbol, or mystical sign or sacred sign,
to designate that of which we here speak.</p>

<p> So much will suffice in explanation of the word sacrament.
What we have said applies equally to the Sacraments of the Old
Law; but since they have been superseded by the Gospel Law and
grace, it is not necessary that pastors give instruction
concerning them. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Definition of a Sacrament</h3>

<p>Besides the meaning of the word, which has hitherto engaged
our attention, the nature and efficacy of the thing which the
word signifies must be diligently considered, and the faithful
must be taught what constitutes a Sacrament. No one can doubt
that the Sacraments are among the means of attaining
righteousness and salvation. But of the many definitions, each of
them sufficiently appropriate, which may serve to explain the
nature of a Sacrament, there is none more comprehensive, none
more perspicuous, than the definition given by St. Augustine and
adopted by all scholastic writers. A Sacrament, he says, is a
sign of a sacred thing; or, as it has been expressed in other
words of the same import: A Sacrament is a visible sign of an
invisible grace, instituted for our justification.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;A Sacrament is a Sign&quot;</h3>

<p>The more fully to develop this definition, the pastor should
ex plain it in all its parts. He should first observe that
sensible objects are of two sorts: some have been invented
precisely to serve as signs; others have been established not for
the sake of signifying something else, but for their own sakes
alone. To the latter class almost every object in nature may be
said to belong; to the former, spoken and written languages,
military standards, images, trumpets, signals a and a
multiplicity of other things of the same sort. Thus with regard
to words; take away their power of expressing ideas, and you seem
to take away the only reason for their invention. Such things
are, therefore, properly called signs. For, according to St.
Augustine, a sign, besides what it presents to the senses, is a
medium through which we arrive at the knowledge of something
else. From a footstep, for instance, which we see traced on the
ground, we instantly infer that some one whose trace appears has
passed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Proof From Reason</h3>

<p>A Sacrament, therefore, is clearly to be numbered among those
things which have been instituted as signs. It makes known to us
by a certain appearance and resemblance that which God, by His
invisible power, accomplishes in our souls. Let us illustrate
what we have said by an example. Baptism, for instance, which is
administered by external ablution, accompanied with certain
solemn words, signifies that by the power of the Holy Ghost all
stain and defilement of sin is inwardly washed away, and that the
soul is enriched and adorned with the admirable gift of heavenly
justification; while, at the same time, the bodily washing, as we
shall hereafter explain in its proper place, accomplishes in the
soul that which it signifies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Proof From Scripture</h3>

<p>That a Sacrament is to be numbered among signs is dearly
inferred also from Scripture. Speaking of circumcision, a
Sacrament of the Old Law which was given to Abraham, the father
of all believers,&quot; the Apostle in his Epistle to the Romans,
says: And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
justice of the faith. In another place he says: All we who are
baptised in Christ Jesus, are baptised in his death, words which
justify the inference that Baptism signifies, to use the words of
the same Apostle, that we are buried together with him by baptism
into death.</p>

<p> Nor is it unimportant that the faithful should know that the
Sacraments are signs. This knowledge will lead them more readily
to believe that what the Sacraments signify, contain and effect
is holy and august; and recognising their sanctity they will be
more disposed to venerate and adore the beneficence of God
displayed towards us.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>&quot;Sign of a Sacred Thing&quot; : Kind of Sign
Meant Here </h3>

<p>We now come to explain the words, sacred thing, which
constitute the second part of the definition. To render this
explanation satisfactory we must enter somewhat more minutely
into the accurate and acute remarks of St. Augustine on the
variety of signs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Natural Signs</h3>

<p>Some signs are called natural. These, besides making
themselves known to us, also convey a knowledge of something
else, an effect, as we have already said, common to all signs.
Smoke, for instance, is a natural sign from which we immediately
infer the existence of fire. It is called a natural sign, because
it implies the existence of fire, not by arbitrary institution,
but from experience. If we see smoke, we are at once convinced of
the presence of fire, even though it is hidden.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Signs Invented By Man,</h3>

<p>Other signs are not natural, but conventional, and are
invented by men to enable them to converse one with another, to
convey their thoughts to others, and in turn to learn the
opinions and receive the advice of other men. The variety and
multiplicity of such signs may be inferred from the fact that
some belong to the eyes, many to the ears, and the rest to the
other senses. Thus when we intimate any thing to another by such
a sensible sign as the raising of a flag, it is obvious that such
intimation is conveyed only through the medium of the eyes; and
it is equally obvious that the sound of the trumpet, of the lute
and of the lyre,­instruments which are not only sources of
pleasure, but frequently signs of ideas ­­ is addressed to the
ear. Through the latter sense especially are also conveyed words,
which are the best medium of communicating our inmost thoughts. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Signs Instituted By God</h3>

<p>Besides the signs instituted by the will and agreement of men,
of which we have been speaking so far, there are certain other
signs appointed by God. These latter, as all admit, are not all
of the same kind. Some were instituted by God to indicate
something or to bring back its recollection. Such were the
purifications of the Law, the unleavened bread, and many other
things which belonged to the ceremonies of the Mosaic worship.
But God has appointed other signs with power not only to signify,
but also to accomplish (what they signify).</p>

<p> Among these are manifestly to be numbered the Sacraments of
the New Law. They are signs instituted not by man but by God,
which we firmly believe have in themselves the power of producing
the sacred effects of which they are the signs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Kind of Sacred Thing Meant Here</h3>

<p>We have seen that there are many kinds of signs. The sacred
thing referred to is also of more than one kind. As regards the
definition already given of a Sacrament, theologians prove that
by the words sacred thing is to be understood the grace of God,
which sanctifies the soul and adorns it with the habit of all the
divine virtues; and of this grace they rightly consider the words
sacred thing, an appropriate appellation, because by its salutary
influence the soul is consecrated and united to God. </p>

<p> In order, therefore, to explain more fully the nature of a
Sacrament, it should be taught that it is a sensible object which
possesses, by divine institution, the power not only of
signifying, but also of accomplishing holiness and righteousness.
Hence it follows, as everyone can easily see, that the images of
the Saints, crosses and the like, although signs of sacred
things, cannot be called Sacraments. That such is the nature of a
Sacrament is easily proved by the example of all the Sacraments,
if we apply to the others what has been already said of Baptism;
namely, that the solemn ablution of the body not only signifies,
but has power to effect a sacred thing which is wrought
interiorly by the operation of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Sacred Things Signified By The Sacraments </h3>

<p>Now it is especially appropriate that these mystical signs,
instituted by God, should signify by the appointment of the Lord
not only one thing, but several things at once.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>All The Sacraments Signify Something Present,
Something Past, Something Future:</h3>

<p>This applies to all the Sacraments; for all of them declare
not only our sanctity and justification, but also two other
things most intimately connected with sanctification, namely, the
Passion of Christ our Redeemer, which is the source of our
sanctification, and also eternal life and heavenly bliss, which
are the end of sanctification. Such, then, being the nature of
all the Sacraments, holy Doctors justly hold that each of them
has a threefold significance: they remind us of something past;
they indicate and point out something present; they foretell
something future.</p>

<p> Nor should it be supposed that this teaching of the Doctors
is unsupported by the testimony of Holy Scripture. When the
Apostle says: All we who are baptised in Christ Jesus, are
baptised in his death, he gives us clearly to understand that
Baptism is called a sign, because it reminds us of the death and
Passion of our Lord. When he says, We are buried together with
him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead
by the glory of the Father, so, we also may walk in newness of
life, he also clearly shows that Baptism is a sign which
indicates the infusion of divine grace into our souls, which
enables us to lead a new life and to perform all the duties of
true piety with ease and cheerfulness. Finally, when he adds: If
we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, he teaches
that Baptism clearly foreshadows eternal life also, which we are
to reach through its efficacy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>A Sacrament Sometimes Signifies The Presence Of More
Than One Thing</h3>

<p>Besides the different significations already mentioned, a
Sacrament also not infrequently indicates and marks the presence
of more than one thing. This we readily perceive when we reflect
that the Holy Eucharist at once signifies the presence of the
real body and blood of Christ and the grace which it imparts to
the worthy receiver of the sacred mysteries.</p>

<p> What has been said, therefore, cannot fail to supply the
pastor with arguments to prove how much the power of God is
displayed, how many hidden miracles are contained in the
Sacraments of the New Law; that thus all may understand that they
are to be venerated and received with utmost devotion.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why the Sacraments were Instituted</h3>

<p>Of all the means employed to teach the proper use of the
Sacraments, there is none more effectual than a careful
exposition of the reasons of their institution. Many such reasons
are commonly assigned. </p>

<p> The first of these reasons is the feebleness of the human
mind. We are so constituted by nature that no one can aspire to
mental and intellectual knowledge unless through the medium of
sensible objects. In order, therefore, that we might more easily
understand what is accomplished by the hidden power of God, the
same sovereign Creator of the universe has most wisely, and out
of His tender kindness towards us, ordained that His power should
be manifested to us through the intervention of certain sensible
signs. As St. Chrysostom happily expresses it: If man were not
clothed with a material body, these good things would have been
presented to him naked and without any covering; but as the soul
is joined to the body, it was absolutely necessary to employ
sensible things in order to assist in making them understood.</p>

<p> Another reason is because the mind yields a reluctant assent
to promises. Hence, from the beginning of the world, God was
accustomed to indicate, and usually in words, that which He had
resolved to do; but sometimes, when designing to execute
something, the magnitude of which might weaken a belief in its
accomplishment, He added to words other signs, which sometimes
appeared miraculous. When, for instance, God sent Moses to
deliver the people of Israel, and Moses, distrusting the help
even of God who had commissioned him, feared that the burden
imposed was heavier than he could bear, or that the people would
not heed his message, the Lord confirmed His promise by a great
variety of signs. As, then, in the Old Law, God ordained that
every important promise should be confirmed by certain signs, so
in the New Law, Christ our Saviour, when He promised pardon of
sin, divine grace, the communication of the Holy Spirit,
instituted certain visible and sensible signs by which He might
oblige Himself, as it were, by pledges, and make it impossible to
doubt that He would be true to His promises. </p>

<p> A third reason is that the Sacraments, to use the words of
St. Ambrose, may be at hand, as the remedies and medicines of the
Samaritan in the Gospel, to preserve or recover the health of the
soul. For, through the Sacraments, as through a channel, must
flow into the soul the efficacy of the Passion of Christ, that
is, the grace which He merited for us on the altar of the cross,
and without which we cannot hope for salvation. Hence, our most
merciful Lord has bequeathed to His Church, Sacraments stamped
with the sanction of His word and promise, through which,
provided we make pious and devout use of these remedies, we
firmly believe that the fruit of His Passion is really
communicated to us.</p>

<p> A fourth reason why the institution of the Sacraments seems
necessary is that there may be certain marks and symbols to
distinguish the faithful; particularly since, as St. Augustine
observes, no society of men, professing a true or a false
religion, can be, so to speak, consolidated into one body, unless
united and held together by some bond of sensible signs. Both
these objects the Sacraments of the New Law accomplish,
distinguishing the Christian from the infidel, and uniting the
faithful by a sort of sacred bond.</p>

<p> Another very just cause for the institution of the Sacraments
may be shown from the words of the Apostle: With the heart we
believe unto justice; but with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation. By approaching them we make a public profession of our
faith in the sight of men. Thus, when we approach Baptism, we
openly profess our belief that, by virtue of its salutary waters
in which we are washed, the soul is spiritually cleansed.</p>

<p> The Sacraments have also great influence, not only in
exciting and exercising our faith, but also in inflaming that
charity with which we should love one another, when we recollect
that, by partaking of these mysteries in common, we are knit
together in the closest bonds and are made members of one body.</p>

<p> A final consideration, which is of greatest importance for
the life of a Christian, is that the Sacraments repress and
subdue the pride of the human heart, and exercise us in the
practice of humility; for they oblige us to subject ourselves to
sensible elements in obedience to God, from whom we had before
impiously revolted in order to serve the elements of the world.</p>

<p> These are the chief points that appeared to us necessary for
the instruction of the faithful on the name, nature, and
institution of a Sacrament. When they shall have been accurately
expounded by the pastor, his next duty will be to explain the
constituents of each Sacrament, its parts, and the rites and
ceremonies which have been added to its administration.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Constituent Parts of the Sacraments</h3>

<p>In the first place, then, it should be explained that the
sensible thing which enters into the definition of a Sacrament as
already given, although constituting but one sign, is twofold.
Every Sacrament consists of two things, matter, which is called
the element, and form, which is commonly called the word.</p>

<p> This is the doctrine of the Fathers of the Church; and the
testimony of St. Augustine on the subject is familiar to all. The
word, he says, is joined to the element and it becomes a
Sacrament. By the words sensible thing, therefore, the Fathers
understand not only the matter or element, such as water in
Baptism, chrism in confirmation, and oil in Extreme Unction, all
of which fall under the eye; but also the words which constitute
the form, and which are addressed to the ear.</p>

<p> Both are clearly pointed out by the Apostle, when he says:
Christ loved the Church, and delivered himself up for it, that he
might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word
of life. Here both the matter and form of the Sacrament are
expressly mentioned.</p>

<p> In order to make the meaning of the rite that is being
performed easier and clearer, words had to be added to the
matter. For of all signs words are evidently the most
significant, and without them, what the matter for the Sacraments
designates and declares would be utterly obscure. Water, for
instance, has the quality of cooling as well as cleansing, and
may be symbolic of either. In Baptism, therefore, unless the
words were added, it would not be certain, but only conjectural,
which signification was intended; but when the words are added,
we immediately understand that the Sacrament possesses and
signifies the power of cleansing. </p>

<p> In this the Sacraments of the New Law excel those of the Old
that, as far as we know, there was no definite form of
administering the latter, and hence they were very uncertain and
obscure. In our Sacraments, on the contrary, the form is so
definite that any, even a casual deviation from it renders the
Sacrament null. Hence the form is expressed in the clearest
terms, such as exclude the possibility of doubt.</p>

<p> These, then, are the parts which belong to the nature and
substance of the Sacraments, and of which every Sacrament is
necessarily composed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Ceremonies Used in the Administration of the
Sacraments</h3>

<p>To (the matter and form) are added certain ceremonies. These
cannot be omitted without sin, unless in case of necessity; yet,
if at any time they be omitted, the Sacrament is not thereby
invalidated, since the ceremonies do not pertain to its essence.
It is not without good reason that the administration of the
Sacraments has been at all times, from the earliest ages of the
Church, accompanied with certain solemn rites.</p>

<p> There is, in the first place, the greatest propriety in
manifesting such a religious reverence to the sacred mysteries as
to make it appear that holy things are handled by holy men. </p>

<p> Secondly, these ceremonies serve to display more fully the
effects of the Sacraments, placing them, as it were, before our
eyes, and to impress more deeply on the minds of the faithful the
sanctity of these sacred institutions.</p>

<p> Thirdly, they elevate to sublime contemplation the minds of
those who behold and observe them with attention, and excite
within them faith and charity.</p>

<p> To enable the faithful, therefore, to know and understand
clearly the meaning of the ceremonies made use of in the
administration of each Sacrament should be an object of special
care and attention. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Number Of The Sacraments</h3>

<p>We now come to explain the number of the Sacraments. A
knowledge of this point is very advantageous to the faithful; for
the greater the number of aids to salvation and the life of bliss
which they understand to have been provided by God, the more
ardent will be the piety with which they will direct all the
powers of their souls to praise and proclaim His singular
goodness towards us. </p>

<p> The Sacraments of the Catholic Church are seven in number, as
is proved from Scripture, from the tradition handed down to us
from the Fathers, and from the authority of Councils. Why they
are neither more nor less in number may be shown, at least</p>

<p> with some probability, from the analogy that exists between
the natural and the spiritual life. In order to exist, to
preserve existence, and to contribute to his own and to the
public good, seven things seem necessary to man: to be born, to
grow, to be nurtured, to be cured when sick, when weak to be
strengthened; as far as regards the public welfare, to have
magistrates invested with authority to govern, and to perpetuate
himself and his species by legitimate offspring. Now, since it is
quite clear that all these things are sufficiently analogous to
that life by which the soul lives to God, we discover in them a
reason to account for the number of the Sacraments.</p>

<p> First comes Baptism, which is the gate, as it were, to all
the other Sacraments, and by which we are born again unto Christ.
The next is Confirmation, by which we grow up and are
strengthened in the grace of God; for, as St. Augustine observes,
to the Apostles who had already received Baptism, the Redeemer
said: &quot;Stay you in the city till you be endued with power
from on high.,, The third is the Eucharist, that true bread from
heaven which nourishes and sustains our souls to eternal life,
according to these words of the Saviour: My flesh is meat indeed,
and my blood is drink indeed. The fourth is Penance, through
which lost health is recovered after we have been wounded by sin.
Next is Extreme Unction, which obliterates the remains of sin and
invigorates the powers of the soul; for speaking of this
Sacrament St. James says: If he be in sins, they shall be
forgiven him. Then follows Holy Orders, by which power is given
to exercise perpetually in the Church the public administration
of the Sacraments and to perform all the sacred functions. The
last is Matrimony, instituted to the end that, by means of the
legitimate and holy union of man and woman, children may be
procreated and religiously educated for the service of God, and
for the preservation of the human race.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Comparisons among the Sacraments</h3>

<p>Though all the Sacraments possess a divine and admirable
efficacy, it is well worthy of special remark that all are not of
equal necessity or of equal dignity, nor is the signification of
all the same.</p>

<p> Among them three are said to be necessary beyond the rest,
although in all three this necessity is not of the same kind. The
universal and absolute necessity of Baptism our Saviour has
declared in these words: Unless a man be born again of water and
the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Penance,
on the other hand, is necessary for those only who have stained
themselves after Baptism by any mortal guilt. Without sincere
repentance, their eternal ruin is inevitable. Orders, too,
although not necessary to each of the faithful, are of absolute
necessity to the Church as a whole.</p>

<p> But if we consider the dignity of the Sacraments, the
Eucharist, for holiness and for the number and greatness of its
mysteries, is far superior to all the rest. These, however, are
matters which will be more easily understood, when we come to
explain, in its proper place, what regards each of the
Sacraments. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Author of the Sacraments</h3>

<p>It now remains to inquire from whom we have received these
sacred and divine mysteries. Any gift, however excellent in
itself, undoubtedly receives an increased value from the dignity
and excellence of him by whom it is bestowed.</p>

<p> The present question, however, is not hard to answer. For
since human justification comes from God, and since the
Sacraments are the wonderful instruments of justification, it is
evident that one and the same God in Christ, must be acknowledged
to be the author of justification and of the Sacraments.</p>

<p> Furthermore, the Sacraments contain a power and efficacy
which reach the inmost soul; and as God alone has power to enter
into the hearts and minds of men, He alone, through Christ, is
manifestly the author of the Sacraments.</p>

<p> That they are also interiorly dispensed by Him we must hold
with a firm and certain faith, according to these words of St.
John, in which he declares that he learned this truth concerning
Christ: He who sent me to baptise with water, said to me: He,
upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining
upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Ministers of the Sacraments</h3>

<p>But although God is the author and dispenser of the
Sacraments, He nevertheless willed that they should be
administered in His Church by men, not by Angels. To constitute a
Sacrament, as the unbroken tradition of the Fathers testifies,
matter and form are not more necessary than is the ministry of
men.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Unworthiness Of The Minister And Validity</h3>

<p>Since the ministers of the Sacraments represent in the
discharge of their sacred functions, not their own, but the
person of Christ, be they good or bad, they validly perform and
confer the Sacraments, provided they make use of the matter and
form always observed in the Catholic Church according to the
institution of Christ, and provided they intend to do what the
Church does in their administration. Hence, unless the recipients
wish to deprive themselves of so great a good and resist the Holy
Ghost, nothing can prevent them from receiving (through the
Sacraments) the fruit of grace.</p>

<p> That this was, at all times, a fixed and well ascertained
doctrine of the Church, is established beyond all doubt by St.
Augustine, in his disputations against the Donatists. And should
we desire Scriptural proof also, let us listen to these words of
the Apostle: I have planted; Apollo watered; but God gave the
increase Therefore neither he that planteth nor he that watereth
is any</p>

<p> thing, but God who giveth the increase. From these words it
is clear that as trees are not injured by the wickedness of those
who planted them, so those who were planted in Christ by the
ministry of bad men sustain no injury from the guilt of those
others.</p>

<p> Judas Iscariot, as the holy Fathers infer from the Gospel of
St. John, conferred Baptism on many; and yet none of those whom
he baptised are recorded to have been baptised again. To use the
memorable words of St. Augustine: Judas baptised, and yet after
him none were rebaptised; John baptised, and after John they were
rebaptised . For the Baptism administered by Judas was the
Baptism of Christ, but that administered by John was the baptism
of John. Not that we prefer Judas to John, but that we justly
prefer the Baptism of Christ, although administered by Judas, to
that of John although administered by the hands of John.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Lawfulness Of Administration</h3>

<p>But let not pastors, or other ministers of the Sacraments,
hence infer that they fully acquit themselves of their duty, if,
disregarding integrity of life and purity of morals, they attend
only to the administration of the Sacraments in the manner
prescribed. True, the manner of administering them demands
particular diligence; yet this alone does not constitute all that
pertains to that duty. It should never be forgotten that the
Sacraments, although they cannot lose the divine efficacy
inherent in them, bring eternal death and perdition to him who
dares administer them unworthily. </p>

<p> Holy things, it cannot be too often repeated, should be
treated holily and with due reverence. To the sinner, says the
Prophet, God has said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and
take my covenant in thy mouth, seeing that thou hast hated
discipline? If then, for him who is defiled by sin it is unlawful
to speak on divine things, how enormous the guilt of that man,
who, conscious of many crimes, dreads not to accomplish with
polluted lips the holy mysteries, to take them into his befouled
hands, to touch</p>

<p> them, and to present and administer them to others? All the
more since St. Denis says that the wicked may not even touch the
symbols, as he calls the Sacraments.</p>

<p> It therefore becomes the first duty of the minister of holy
things to follow holiness of life, to approach with purity the
administration of the Sacraments, and so to exercise himself in
piety, that, from their frequent administration and use, he may
every day receive, with the divine assistance, more abundant
grace.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Effects of the Sacraments</h3>

<p>When these matters have been explained, the effects of the
Sacraments are the next subject of instruction. This subject
should throw considerable light on the definition of a Sacrament
as already given.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>First Effect: Justifying Grace</h3>

<p>The principal effects of the Sacraments are two. The first
place is rightly held by that grace which we, following the usage
of the holy Doctors, call sanctifying. For so the Apostle most
clearly taught when he said: Christ loved the church, and
delivered himself up for it; that he might sanctify it, cleansing
it by the laver of water in the word of life. But how so great
and so admirable an effect is produced by the Sacrament that, to
use the well­known saying of St. Augustine, water cleanses the
body and reaches the heart, ­­ this, indeed, cannot be
comprehended by human reason and intelligence. It may be taken
for granted that no sensible thing is of its own nature able to
reach the soul; but we know by the light of faith that in the
Sacraments there exists the power of almighty God by which they
effect that which the natural elements cannot of themselves
accomplish. </p>

<p> Lest on this subject any doubt should exist in the minds of
the faithful, God, in the abundance of His mercy, was pleased,</p>

<p> from the moment when the Sacraments began to be administered,
to manifest by the evidence of miracles the effects which they
operate interiorly in the soul. (This He did) in order that we
may most firmly believe that the same effects, although far
removed from the senses, are always inwardly produced. To say
nothing of the fact that at the Baptism of the Redeemer in the
Jordan the heavens were opened and the Holy Ghost appeared in the
form of a dove, to teach us that when we are washed in the sacred
font His grace is infused into our souls ­­ to omit this, which
has reference rather to the signification of Baptism than to the
administration of the Sacrament ­­ do we not read that on the
day of Pentecost, when the Apostles received the Holy Ghost, by
whom they were thenceforward inspired with greater alacrity and
resolution to preach the faith and brave dangers for the glory of
Christ, there came suddenly a sound from heaven, as of a mighty
wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were
sitting, and there appeared to them parted tongues, as it were,
of fire? By this it was understood that in the Sacrament of
Confirmation the same Spirit is given us, and such strength is
imparted as enables us resolutely to encounter and resist our
incessant enemies, the world, the flesh and the devil. For some
time in the beginning of the Church, whenever these Sacraments
were administered by the Apostles, the same miraculous effects
were witnessed, and they ceased only when the faith had acquired
maturity and strength.</p>

<p> From what has been said of sanctifying grace, the first
effect of the Sacraments, it clearly follows that there resides
in the Sacraments of the New Law, a virtue more exalted and
efficacious than that of the sacraments of the Old Law. Those
ancient sacraments, being weak and needy elements, sanctified
such as were defiled to the cleansing of the flesh, but not of
the spirit. They were, therefore, instituted only as signs of
those things, which were to be accomplished by our mysteries. The
Sacraments of the New Law, on the contrary, flowing from the side
of Christ, who, by the Holy Ghost, offered himself unspotted unto
God, cleanse our consciences from dead works, to</p>

<p> serve the living God, and thus work in us, through the blood
of Christ, the grace which they signify. Comparing our
Sacraments, therefore, with those of the Old Law we find that
they are not only more efficacious, but also more fruitful in
spiritual advantages, and more august in holiness.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Second Effect: Sacramental Character</h3>

<p>The second effect of the Sacraments ­­ which, however, is
not common to all, but peculiar to three, Baptism, Confirmation,
and Holy Orders ­­ is the character which they impress on the
soul. When the Apostle says: God hath anointed us, who also hath
sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts, he
not obscurely describes by the word sealed a character, the
property of which is to impress a seal and mark. </p>

<p> This character is, as it were, a distinctive impression
stamped on the soul which perpetually inheres and cannot be
blotted out. Of this St. Augustine says: Shall the Christian
Sacraments accomplish less than the bodily mark impressed on the
soldier? That mark is not stamped on his person anew as often as
he resumes the military service which he had relinquished, but
the old is recognised and approved.</p>

<p> This character has a twofold effect: it qualifies us to
receive or perform something sacred, and distinguishes us by some
mark one from another. In the character impressed by Baptism,
both effects are exemplified. By it we are qualified to receive
the other Sacraments, and the Christian is distinguished from
those who do not profess the faith. The same illustration is
afforded by the characters impressed by Confirmation and Holy
Orders. By Confirmation we are armed and arrayed as soldiers of
Christ, publicly to profess and defend His name, to fight against
our internal enemy and against the spiritual powers of wickedness
in the high places; and at the same time we are distinguished
from those who, being recently baptised, are, as it were,
new­born infants. Holy Orders confers the power of consecrating
and administering the Sacraments, and also distinguishes those
who are invested </p>

<p> with this power from the rest of the faithful. The rule of
the Catholic Church is, therefore, to be observed, which teaches
that these three Sacraments impress a character and are never to
be repeated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How to Make Instruction on the Sacraments Profitable </h3>

<p>On the subject of the Sacraments in general, the above are the
matters on which instruction should be given. In explaining them,
pastors should keep in view principally two things, which they
should zealously strive to accomplish. The first is that the
faithful understand the high honour, respect and veneration due
to these divine and celestial gifts. The second is that, since
the Sacraments have been established by the God of infinite mercy
for the common salvation of all, the people should make pious and
religious use of them, and be so inflamed with the desire of
Christian perfection as to deem it a very great loss to be for
any time deprived of the salutary use, particularly of Penance
and the Holy Eucharist. </p>

<p> These objects pastors will find little difficulty in
accomplishing, if they call frequently to the attention of the
faithful what we have already said on the divine character and
fruit of the Sacraments: first, that they were instituted by our
Lord and Saviour from whom can proceed nothing but what is most
perfect; further that when administered, the most powerful
influence of the Holy Ghost is present, pervading the inmost
sanctuary of the soul; next that they possess an admirable and
unfailing virtue to cure our spiritual maladies, and communicate
to us the inexhaustible riches of the Passion of our Lord.</p>

<p> Finally, let them point out, that although the whole edifice
of Christian piety rests on the most firm foundation of the
cornerstone; yet, unless it be supported on every side by the
preaching of the divine Word and by the use of the Sacraments, it
is greatly to be feared that it may to a great extent totter and
fall to the ground. For as we are ushered into spiritual life by
means of the Sacraments, so by the same means are we nourished
and preserved, and grow to spiritual increase.</p>
